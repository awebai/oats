// The pair table, walked (awebai/oats#866, feature `lifecycle-claim-stop`). A retire and a stop
// apply hold the home's claim, and `oats worktree add` reads it. What each of the three answers
// when it ARRIVES on a home that another command is on is one table, docs/desktop-cli-api.md
// "Commands that meet on one home" (anchor `lifecycle-pairs`), which the kernel builds from one
// place (lib/core.mjs lifecycleClaimRefusals). The table is a contract a client reads cell by cell:
// "refused, nothing happened, and the command already there goes on".
//
// This file reads the table out of the docs page and runs every cell through the real CLI in JSON
// mode, on a fresh instance home put in the row's state:
//   - the code is the cell's, or, for `not refused`, the command does what it does (a retire
//     retires, a stop stops and its receipt is ok, the tree is made);
//   - for a refused cell, nothing happened: the whole deployment (the home, the claims, receipts
//     and markers beside it, the clone's branches and worktrees, the tree records, the event logs)
//     is byte for byte what it was, the instance's harness still runs, and the command already on
//     the home is as it was and completes once it is let go;
//   - `error.details` is what the docs say of a claim's refusal: the HOLDER's verb in `action`,
//     and `holder` (lib/errors.mjs BUSY_HOLDERS) on every E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY and on no other code.
// The table is the source of the cells; the setups are this file's. A row or a column the docs gain
// breaks the first test until someone teaches this file its setup, and one they lose breaks it too.
//
// It also pins the notes under the table that are about one home: a holder is answered before a
// stale plan by both verbs (every refused cell of a claim is run again with a revision no plan
// has), `--plan` of either verb is never refused and a stop plan reports the holder, and the two
// halves of the note on a scheduled self-retire (a plan that showed `retiring` → the cell; a plan
// shown before the scheduling → E_PLAN_STALE first).
//
// The three rules of "Several targets" (a stop of a parent whose recorded child is being retired;
// two overlapping stops of one parent; a retire whose recorded child is held by someone else) are
// NOT here: test/stop-claim.test.mjs and test/retire-children-claim.test.mjs pin them. The exact
// sentences of each refusal are the business of the tests of each verb (those two files,
// test/retire-exclusive.test.mjs, test/worktree*.test.mjs) and of test/lifecycle-busy-holder.test.mjs.
//
// No pause rests on timing: a command "already on the home" is the kernel's own CLI, held by
// test/helpers/fs-gate-preload.mjs at the return of the `linkSync` that takes its claim, which is
// before anything it does to the home.
