// A spawn writes the home's record through a private file renamed over it (#1659), the last time
// after the session has started: a status, a Desktop listing or a start that reads the record meets
// it before or after a write, never part of one. Each write is held by test/helpers/fs-gate-preload.mjs
// at its own rename, where a second reader is, so a write that goes back to writing the record in
// place reaches no gate. The record's bytes and mode are what they were (the retirement baseline
// digests both), and a spawn killed at a rename leaves a file that no retire counts as a change.
