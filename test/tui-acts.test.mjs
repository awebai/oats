// `oats tui` stops, starts, restarts and retires an agent (awebai/oats#855, PR 5; docs/tui.md,
// "Stopping, starting, restarting and retiring"), with real processes: an act it sent is a change,
// and the TUI never ends a change. Spec 5, "Tests", real processes 1 to 4; and (test 5) spawns one
// (Spec 6-spawn, "Tests", tui-terminal), with the real kernel.
//
// RUN ON CI ONLY, never on a shared host. Real tmux throughout, never the operator's: the terminal
// is a pane of a private server on a socket in this file's own temp dir (`-S`), the kernel's tmux is
// the fixture's (host-fixture.mjs isolateSessionEnvironment: a private TMUX_TMPDIR, TMUX and
// TMUX_PANE gone from every child's environment), and the last test checks that the default tmux
// server's sessions are what they were before this file ran.
//
// Tests 1 and 4 need a kernel whose stop apply waits: the TUI runs the kernel of its own install
// (packages/tui/lib/read.mjs KERNEL_BIN, `../../../bin/oats.mjs`), so the TUI and the shared readers
// are copied under a directory whose `bin/oats.mjs` is a fake that hands every command to the real
// kernel but a stop apply. That apply writes its pid, records any signal it is sent (and does not
// end on it), waits for a file of the test's, then (test 1) writes to stdout and to stderr after the
// TUI has gone and only then its completion marker, or (test 2) runs the real kernel's apply, which
// prints its envelope after the TUI's terminal was killed. Test 3 is the real TUI and the real
// kernel end to end. A signal goes only to a pid the test's own wrapper or the fake wrote down.
