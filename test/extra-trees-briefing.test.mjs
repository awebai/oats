// The "Extra trees" briefing. The worktree and checkout work-mode injects share one section that
// tells an agent how to make a tree of its own for another branch or repository. These tests hold
// that section to two things: it is the same text in both injects (and so in every composed
// AGENTS.md of those modes), and its commands do what the prose around them says — run verbatim, as
// the command lines taken from the inject itself (`oats worktree add|remove`, #796), from a real
// instance home of a scratch deployment whose member clone has a bare origin:
//   - the tree starts from the remote's current state even when the clone's remote-tracking refs
//     are stale, and creating it moves none of the clone's refs beyond the new branch;
//   - `add` refuses a branch name that already exists in the clone;
//   - reworking an existing remote branch under `<instance>/<branch>` and pushing with
//     `HEAD:<remote-branch>` changes that one remote branch and nothing else.
