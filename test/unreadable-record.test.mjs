// have nothing to do with it: the listing read and parsed every record with no catch, so `oats
// status` died with a stack and every other instance's stop and retire was refused. Now:
//
//   - `oats status` lists every instance; that home's row has the fields of a home without a
//     record, with `running: null`, `runtimeState: "unreachable"` and a `runtimeError` that names
//     the file and the reason;
//   - every command about ANOTHER instance answers as if that home were not there;
//   - every lifecycle command about THAT home (retire, retire --plan, retire --force, a guarded
//     retire, instance stop --plan and --apply, session start and restart) is refused with
//     E_UNIDENTIFIED_INSTANCE_HOME before any effect, and the home is byte-identical afterwards;
//   - a home with NO record (the stub of awebai/oats#866) answers as before.
//
// Every case runs the real CLI against a file shape that fails the same way each time.
