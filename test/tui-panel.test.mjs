// `oats tui` opens an agent's terminal in a panel beside the list: Enter on a running instance
// starts the kernel's own viewer, `oats session attach --home <home>` with no key of its own, in a
// pane of a private tmux server the run owns, and the TUI draws that pane's screen where the detail
// was (docs/tui.md, "Open an agent's terminal"). Typing goes to the agent; the leader (by default
// Ctrl+X) then Esc gives the focus to the list, z zooms, c closes.
//
// Real tmux throughout, never the operator's (the conventions of test/tui-terminal.test.mjs): the
// fixture owns a private TMUX_TMPDIR, and every server here is a socket inside the fixture. AGENTS
// is the server the homes record: the agent's window runs a small program that shows every byte it
// reads. TERM plays the user's terminal: its pane runs an interactive shell, the real `oats tui` is
// typed there through the checkout's CLI with TMPDIR a short directory of the fixture's, so the
// run's private directory, and the socket of its private server in it, are inside the fixture too
// (the fixture's tmux refuses any other socket, and a socket path has a short limit). A signal goes
// only to the pid the command's own wrapper wrote down. Every wait is on what a pane shows or on a
// file, within the file's budget. The panel's tabs (up to four viewers, up to two of them displayed
// at once, each in its own window at its own size, one of them shown) are proved on the panel
// itself over the same real tmux, and every way out with four tabs open and two displayed under the
// TUI's own guard (the tests after "the tabs" below); q and kill -9 with four agents' terminals open
// as tabs of the real `oats tui` close the file ("four agents, four tabs").
