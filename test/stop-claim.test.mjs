// A stop takes the home's claim (awebai/oats#866, #890; feature `lifecycle-claim-stop`).
//
// `oats instance stop <name> --apply` holds the lifecycle claim of EVERY target
// (<instances>/.oats-retirement/claims/<instance>.lock, the file a retire holds, lib/core.mjs
// claimHomeFor) from before it stops the first one until it has written its receipt. The claim's
// record names the holder's verb (`action`: "stop" or "retire") from the instant the file exists.
//
// What that changes, and what the tests below hold:
//   - #866: a stop used to know nothing of a retire in flight. It wrote its marker, its record and
//     its receipt into a home the retire was copying or removing, and a retire stopped, copied and
//     removed a home a stop was still working in. Now each is refused beside the other, at once
//     and before any effect: E_INSTANCE_RETIRING for a stop beside a retire, E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY
//     (`holder: "running"`) for a retire beside a stop and for a stop beside a stop.
//   - #890: a stop said "in progress" with a file in the home, `.oats-stop-pending.json`, that named
//     no process. A stop apply that was killed left it there, and every later stop of that home
//     answered "already has a stop in progress" for ever. A claim names its holder by pid and start
//     time: one left by a process that died is taken over by the next command that wants it. The
//     stops that are killed are in test/stop-claim-killed.test.mjs.
//   - the plan is read again under the claims and compared once with the revision the caller sent;
//     a holder is answered before a stale plan; `--grace-ms` out of range refuses the whole apply
//     before the plan; a marker an older kernel left refuses nothing and is removed.
//
// No outcome rests on a sleep or on which process is faster. "A stop is in flight" and "a retire
// is at this phase" are made with test/helpers/fs-gate-preload.mjs: the real CLI, as a child, is
// held at one named `node:fs` call of the kernel's own until the test releases it. The two calls a
// stop is held at are named where they are defined (beforeFirstStop, claimTaken).
//
// Each test says, in a comment that starts with "Before:", what the kernel before 5642fd2f answered.
