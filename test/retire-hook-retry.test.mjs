// A deferred self-retire whose cleanup is left incomplete by retire hooks alone retries it before it
// gives up (awebai/oats#1747).
//
// The completion of `oats retire --self` (lib/core.mjs completeDeferredRetirement) runs with nobody at
// a terminal. When its retire ends in a quarantine that owes retire hooks and nothing else, it runs
// the same retire again after each delay of RETIRE_RETRY_DELAYS_MS (here a few milliseconds, the
// function's `retryDelaysMs`), each attempt a plain retire under the home's claim with its own
// `retired` row. This file pins:
//   - a retry whose hooks pass ends as a first-time success does: the home is gone and nothing is left
//     beside it (marker, outcome, log, retry state), in directory and worktree mode;
//   - after the last failed attempt the outcome is as before, with `attempts`; the marker stays, four
//     `retired` rows carry their hooks, and one `retire-refused` row follows them;
//   - a quarantine that owes a Git step is not retried, whether it owed it from the start (the
//     outcome is then byte for byte as before) or came to owe it between two attempts;
//   - an attempt that answers an error ends the retries, with that code;
//   - while it waits, `oats status` reads the retire as running, and another retire is refused with
//     E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY, a clause that names the next attempt, and the same `details` as without it.
//
// The completion is a child of the test that runs the function from an intent, as the detached
// script does, with no delay. The marker it reads is written by the test, as the scheduling writes it.
