// Every session start and restart holds the home's lifecycle claim (#1602, feature
// `lifecycle-claim-start`), as a `start` holder, the way a resume holds it as `resume` (#1559).
// Before, an ordinary start took no claim and could race a retire: it could begin while a retire
// removed the home, and leave a session running in a home that was gone. Now:
//   - a start beside a retire is refused E_INSTANCE_RETIRING, and a retire beside a start
//     E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY (`details.action: "start"`), each before any effect;
//   - a restart holds ONE claim across its stop and its launch: no retire comes between them;
//   - two starts still answer E_SESSION_START_BUSY, as they did at the start lock;
//   - the claim is released on every exit of a start, a failed launch included;
//   - a scheduled start refused at the claim is a skip that holds no slot, and the sweep skips a
//     home a start holds.
// The pair table itself (every arriving command against every holder) is walked by
// test/lifecycle-pair-table.test.mjs. On real tmux: each fixture's own `oats` server
// (v2Deployment), a stand-in harness that records each launch and sleeps. A command "already on
// the home" is the kernel's own CLI held by test/helpers/fs-gate-preload.mjs at the call named,
// never a race against the clock.
