// The same table holds the release workflow to the code that was read. release.yml publishes, so
// it names every action by the full commit id of a row, and so does build-installers.yml, whose
// installer steps are release.yml's, and tui-macos.yml, by the release lane's call. Every other
// workflow names the major of a row by its tag.
//
// The system release.yml and build-installers.yml run on is the same question one layer down, and
// those two answer it the same way: every job of theirs runs on a runner of the list below.
