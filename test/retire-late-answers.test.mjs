// What a retire answers once something has happened, and the codes it keeps for "nothing happened"
// (awebai/oats#895; lib/errors.mjs BEFORE_EFFECT_CODES and afterFirstEffect).
//
// A client reads some codes of `oats retire` and `oats instance stop` as "refused, nothing
// happened": E_PLAN_STALE, E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY, E_BAD_ARGS, E_UNIDENTIFIED_INSTANCE_HOME and the rest
// of BEFORE_EFFECT_CODES. Two answers of a retire carried such a code after it had acted:
//
//   - a guarded retire whose extra worktrees changed between the plan it revalidated and the step
//     that deals with them answered E_PLAN_STALE, although its retire hooks had run by then. It is
//     now E_WORK_PRESERVATION_FAILED, with the same words;
//   - a retire that signalled the worktree-hook process group an interrupted spawn left, and saw it
//     survive SIGTERM and SIGKILL, answered E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY. It is now E_RUNTIME_QUIESCE_FAILED.
//
// And the rule now holds for the places nobody thought of: an error that leaves a retire with a
// listed code once `reached.phase` is past "before-effects" (or a stop apply once its first
// target's stop began) is answered E_LIFECYCLE_FAILED, `oats <verb> answered <code> after its first
// effect (<point>): <its message>`, `details.cause: { name: "LateRefusal" }`, and its stack is
// printed on stderr: it is a kernel defect, and no client is told that nothing happened.
//
// The last tests pin the other side of the list for one code: E_UNIDENTIFIED_INSTANCE_HOME is
// answered before any effect by every form of the two verbs, and the home is byte-identical after
// each refusal (test/unreadable-record.test.mjs pins the code and its words, shape by shape).
//
// Nothing here rests on a sleep. The retire whose tree changes is HELD at the first read its
// inspection after the hooks makes (test/helpers/fs-gate-preload.mjs), the test dirties the tree
// as a second writer, and lets it go on. The late refusal is raised by a preload this file writes,
// at one `node:fs` call the retire makes only once its own retire hook has run.
