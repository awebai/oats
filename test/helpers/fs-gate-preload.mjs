// A pause, or a fault, at one named call. Loaded into ONE kernel CLI child process with
// `node --import <this file> bin/oats.mjs …`, it holds one named `node:fs` sync call of that
// process until the test releases it, or makes that call fail with a code of the system's. A gate
// that pauses changes no argument, no result and no kernel file: the call it holds is the kernel's
// own, made with the kernel's own arguments, and it returns or throws what it would have. A gate
// that throws (`throws`) changes one thing, and says so in the test that sets it: that call fails.
//
// Why it exists: some answers of the kernel need a second writer at an exact moment, an entry that
// vanishes between a walk's listing and its read (awebai/oats#892), a claim taken between two
// steps of a lifecycle command (awebai/oats#866). Such a window is a few microseconds wide. A test
// must not race the wall clock for it: it holds the kernel at the call, does what the second
// writer does, and lets the kernel go on. Others need the system to refuse a write that no file
// shape refuses on every host and for every user: a full file system (awebai/oats#946). A test
// must not fill one: it names the call and the code.
//
// This file has two parts.
//
// 1. The preload (the kernel child). It installs gates only when OATS_TEST_GATES is set, so
//    importing this file in a test process installs nothing.
//
//    OATS_TEST_GATE_DIR  a directory OUTSIDE the deployment. `<name>.entered` is written when a
//                        gate is reached, and the held call goes on once `<name>.release` exists.
//    OATS_TEST_GATES     JSON, a list of gates:
//                        { name, fn, path | prefix, when?, nth?, arg?, contains?, armed?, waitMs?,
//                          throws?, every? }
//      name      the gate's name: the stem of its files in the gate directory
//      fn        a `node:fs` sync function (`lstatSync`, `readFileSync`, `linkSync`…)
//      path      the call matches when argument `arg` (default 0) is exactly this path;
//      prefix    or when it starts with this one. A path may reach the call as text or as bytes
//                (the kernel's walk reads names as bytes: `lstatSync(Buffer)`): both match.
//      when      "before" (default): hold the call before it is made; "after": once it has
//                returned or thrown
//      nth       the gate fires on the Nth matching call (default 1), once. A retire inspects
//                the home three times: `nth` picks which inspection is held.
//      contains  the call matches only when its second argument (the bytes a write is given)
//                holds this text
//      armed     the call matches only once this file exists
//      waitMs    how long a held call waits for its release (default 30 s)
//      throws    a code of the system's (`ENOSPC`, `EACCES`, `EIO`…). The gate does not hold the
//                call: it makes it fail with an error shaped as Node's own for that code (`code`,
//                `errno`, `syscall`, `path`, and a message that starts with the code). "before":
//                the call is not made, as when the system refuses it outright; "after": the call
//                is made, and fails once it has returned (a file that was created, and whose
//                write then found no space). `<name>.entered` is written the first time it
//                fires, and nothing waits for a release.
//      every     the gate fires on every matching call from the Nth on, not once: a file system
//                that is full refuses each write. Only with `throws`.
//
//    The wait is bounded and fails loudly: a release that never comes writes `<name>.timeout`
//    and lets the call go on, so no kernel process is left held, and the driver below reports the
//    gate in `timedOut`, which a test asserts is empty. Both variables are removed from the
//    process's environment once read: what the kernel hands its own children (hooks, git, a
//    detached completion) is what it would hand them without this file.
//
// 2. The driver (the test process): `startGated` and `runFaulted`, named exports. The driver
//    lives here, not in each test file, so that every suite that needs a pause or a fault starts
//    and ends its child the same way.
//
//      const run = startGated([CLI, "retire", name, "--json"], { cwd: fx.dep, env: fx.env,
//        gateDir: join(fx.base, "gates"), gates: [{ name: "walk", fn: "lstatSync", path }] });
//      try {
//        await run.waitGate("walk");          // the kernel is held at that call
//        rmSync(path);                        // the second writer
//        run.release("walk");
//        const { code, stdout, stderr, timedOut } = await run.done;
//        …
//      } finally { await run.finish(); }      // releases every gate and waits for the exit
//
//    No sleep synchronises anything: `waitGate` polls for `<name>.entered` with a bound and
//    rejects, with the child's output, when the bound passes or the child exits first. Always
//    `finish()` in a `finally`: a failed assertion must not leave a held kernel process behind
//    (a fixture's cleanup fails the test when a process still works in its base).
//
//    A child whose gates all throw is held nowhere, so it is run to its end in one call:
//
//      const r = runFaulted([CLI, "instance", "stop", name, "--apply", …], { cwd: fx.dep,
//        env: fx.env, gateDir: join(fx.base, "faults"),
//        gates: [{ name: "full", fn: "writeFileSync", prefix: fx.dep, throws: "ENOSPC", every: true }] });
//      assert.deepEqual(r.fired, ["full"]);   // the fault was met: the answer is the kernel's to it
