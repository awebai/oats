// The ONE minimal workspace-model deployment for tests that spawn, schedule, retire
// or read a deployment (lead decision c3-1). Northwind (test/fixtures/northwind) is
// the realistic multi-repo company; this is the smallest real thing:
//
//   <base>/remotes/ws.git   one bare repo that is BOTH the workspace host and its only
//                           member: oats-workspace.yaml (members: [itself]),
//                           oats-membership.yaml, souls/<name>/, capabilities/<id>/
//   <base>/deployment/      oats-local.yaml → the host; agents/; ws/ (the member clone
//                           a `work: worktree|checkout` soul works in, by convention)
//
// Spawns go through the real kernel path, exactly as bin/oats.mjs does it:
// prepareInstance (discovery over the local remote) → ensureWorkspaceSoul →
// spawnInstanceAsync. No network, no packages, no catalog, never bare `oats setup`;
// HOME, the remote cache, tmux and the harnesses are isolated. tmux: a session name that does not
// exist, and a private TMUX_TMPDIR, so the server the kernel selects by name (`tmux -L oats`) is the
// fixture's own, never the operator's. Inside a session environment (isolateSessionEnvironment, which
// must be installed first) that environment's TMUX_TMPDIR is used, so both name one `oats` server.
