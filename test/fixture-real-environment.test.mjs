// awebai/oats#1010: a fixture forces its environment on the real process.env, never by replacing
// the object. A kernel call that starts a child with no `env` option (the tmux lookups, git) gives
// it the process's environment, and which one that is after `process.env = {…}` depends on the Node
// that runs the suite: from v26.11.0 the child gets the real environment, not the replacement. A
// fixture that replaced the object then let those calls out, onto the operator's own tmux server.
//
// The cases that start a child run in a `node` of their own, with a session's variables in its
// environment and a PATH that holds only a stand-in `tmux` and a few tools: no real tmux can be
// reached from them, whatever environment a call ends up with.
