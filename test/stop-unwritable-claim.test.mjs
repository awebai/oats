// A stop whose claim cannot be written reads it instead (awebai/oats#946).
//
// `oats instance stop --apply` holds the home's claim (test/stop-claim.test.mjs), so it has to
// WRITE it: from 0.52.0 a stop whose claim could not be written was refused before it signalled
// anything. A full disk is the likely case, and one of the reasons a person presses Stop. Now a
// stop apply, and it alone, reads the claim where it cannot write it for a reason that stops every
// other writer of this user as well (lib/claim.mjs CLAIM_UNWRITABLE_CODES), and goes on when
// nobody holds it, holding nothing for that target and saying so on stderr.
//
// What the tests below hold, through the real CLI:
//   - with nobody holding the claim the session is stopped, the answer is the receipt of any stop,
//     and stderr has one warning per target that was only read, in text and in JSON mode;
//   - beside a holder, and beside a file that is no claim, the answer is the one the same apply
//     gets when it CAN write: the two are compared whole, so no sentence is repeated here;
//   - a holder that is verifiably gone is nobody, and its file is left as it was;
//   - the read is positive or it is nothing: when the claim cannot be read either, the answer is
//     the refusal of the write;
//   - the last look: the read is made again once the plan has been read under the claims, so a
//     holder that came in between is answered, before a stale plan and before any signal;
//   - of several targets it holds what it could write and reads the others;
//   - a retire, and a retire's stop of a recorded child, answer as they did;
//   - a file system that is full for every write of the stop: what the apply answers, and what
//     the same key answers afterwards.
// The claim's own units (each code at each write, what is read at the path) are in
// test/claim.test.mjs.
//
// Two ways to make a write fail, and each test says which:
//   - a file shape that fails the same way each time, with no injection: a directory this user
//     may not write (mode bits, EACCES). Skipped for root, whom a mode does not keep out;
//   - a fault at one named `node:fs` call of the kernel's own, in the one CLI child the test
//     starts (test/helpers/fs-gate-preload.mjs, `throws`): ENOSPC, which no file shape gives on
//     every host. Nothing is filled. The run on a file system that really was full is not a test
//     of this suite; it is named on the pull request.
// No outcome rests on a sleep: where a second writer must come at an exact moment, the stop is
// held at a call of its own (the same preload) until the test has written.
