// The Desktop's launch-prompt readers on the REAL kernel (OATS 0.52.0; docs/desktop-cli-api.md § "Launch
// prompt results" and § "Start and restart"). Nothing here is a hand-written kernel shape: the results come
// from the kernel's own controller (lib/launch-prompts.mjs `createLaunchPromptController`) over a fake
// transport that shows the repository's captured Claude screens (test/helpers/dev-channel-screens.mjs), the
// rows are the data the controller hands its audit, and the refusal is the error
// lib/launch-preference.mjs `launchConfigAmbiguous` builds. Each is then read the way the Desktop reads it
// (packages/client/launch-prompt-outcome.mjs, spawn-preview-cli.mjs, spawn-messages.mjs, and the Activity
// reader in packages/desktop/renderer/instance-events-data.mjs).
//
// Two shapes are composed here as lib/core.mjs composes them, because core does not export the functions:
// the details of E_SPAWN_INCOMPLETE (`retainedPromptError`) and the record of a start where Claude ignored
// the flag (`channelsUnavailable`). The kernel's own tests pin those; this file reads lib/ and edits nothing.
