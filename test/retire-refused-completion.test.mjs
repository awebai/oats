// A scheduled self-retire that does not complete says so, and keeps its marker only when the home
// is owed a retire (awebai/oats#954).
//
// `oats retire <name> --self` only schedules: it writes a pending marker beside the home and starts
// a detached completion (lib/core.mjs completeDeferredRetirement) that runs the retire later, with
// nobody at a terminal. This file pins what a completion that does not complete leaves:
//
//   - its outcome beside the home (the result file and its log), always, as before;
//   - its pending marker only when a retire hook was started or the removal of the home began. With
//     the marker gone the instance reads as any other: not RETIRING in `oats status`, `retiring:
//     false` in a stop plan, and a stop and a start are not answered E_INSTANCE_RETIRING;
//   - one `retire-refused` event, `data: { code, homeChanged, reason }`, in the workspace's log
//     alone, with the incarnation read before the retire ran. Never in the home's log: a completion
//     holds no claim when it writes, so it writes nothing into a home;
//   - only its own marker is removed: the one of the scheduling it completes (the same
//     `requestedAt`) whose named completion is absent, this process, or verifiably gone.
//
// The completion is the real one wherever a test needs no step in between: a self-retire scheduled
// with no delay, whose detached completion the test waits for. Where a test must choose the marker
// or stand between two steps, the completion is a child of the test that runs the same function
// with no delay, from an intent or from the marker's path, as the detached script does.
//
// The scheduling and its completion are two processes, and the scheduling writes the marker last,
// under the home's claim. Two rules order them, and the last tests hold a real scheduling to show
// each:
//   - a completion does not start its retire while the command that scheduled it holds the home's
//     claim, for up to SCHEDULING_WAIT_MS: a scheduling that is only slow does not refuse its own
//     completion, which does not look for a marker that is not written yet. It waits for one
//     reading alone: the claim's holder is that command, by the pid and the start its intent was
//     given in its environment, and reads as alive. The wait ends when the scheduling returns,
//     when it fails, when it dies, and at its bound, where the completion goes on to its retire
//     and that retire waits and is refused as every retire is; a holder whose liveness cannot be
//     read, another holder, and an intent that names no start are not waited for, and the retire
//     answers for them as for every retire;
//   - a scheduling whose completion has ended by the time the marker is written has failed
//     (E_SELF_RETIRE_SCHEDULE_FAILED), and removes the marker it wrote.
// Those tests hold the scheduling for longer than a completion used to wait for the claim: that is
// a wait on purpose, during which the invariants are polled.
//
// "A recorded child that will not stop" is a child whose lifecycle claim cannot be read: its stop
// is refused at once (E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY) and nothing is signalled, so the parent's retire answers
// E_CHILDREN_RUNNING before it touches the parent's home. No outcome rests on a sleep.
