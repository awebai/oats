// Framework-hoisted resources of marketplace-sourced capabilities.
//
// An installed marketplace capability may declare resources that live outside
// its installed copy (`oats.authoring` ships no skills of its own; it selects
// three kernel skills with `../../skills/<name>`). Those declarations are
// written against the capability's directory in the kernel marketplace
// (`<PKG_ROOT>/capabilities/<slug>`), so that is the only correct anchor —
// anchoring at PKG_ROOT resolves two levels above the kernel and nothing
// resolves at all.
//
// Every test here runs against a copy of the kernel shaped like an INSTALLED
// one (package `files` only, nested the way npm installs it) rather than the
// source checkout, because the anchor bug is a path-arithmetic bug: it must be
// visible from wherever the kernel really lives.
