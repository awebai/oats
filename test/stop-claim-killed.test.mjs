// A stop that was killed does not block the next one (awebai/oats#890; feature `lifecycle-claim-stop`).
//
// Before 5642fd2f a stop apply said "a stop is in progress" with a file in the home,
// `.oats-stop-pending.json`, which named no process, and removed it in a `finally`. A stop that was
// killed (a client that ends its call, a caller's timeout, a closed terminal) never reached that
// `finally`: the file stayed, the next plan said `stopPending: true`, and every later apply of that
// home answered E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY, "<name> already has a stop in progress", until somebody removed
// the file by hand.
//
// A stop now holds the home's lifecycle claim (<instances>/.oats-retirement/claims/<instance>.lock,
// lib/core.mjs claimHomeFor), whose record names its holder by pid and start time, with its verb
// (`action: "stop"`). A claim whose holder died, by any signal, reaped or still a zombie, is taken
// over by the next command that wants it (lib/claim.mjs); a plan reads it as no stop in progress.
//
// Two places a stop is killed at, each for SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP, and neither found
// by timing:
//   - with its claims taken and before it stopped anything: the real CLI, as a child, is held at
//     one `node:fs` call of the kernel's own (test/helpers/fs-gate-preload.mjs; beforeFirstStop);
//   - while it waits for the harness it has signalled: the stand-in harness says when SIGTERM
//     reached it, and stays until the test lets it go.
// The other tests of the stop's claim are in test/stop-claim.test.mjs.
