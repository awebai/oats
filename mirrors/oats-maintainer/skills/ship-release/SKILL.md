name: ship-release
description: Ship a planned release as exact artifacts under explicit authority - pin the source, read the project's live release contract, tag, let the release run - then verify the publication item by item with the checklist, and handle a partial or failed publication without hiding it: re-run only the failed step from the same tag, never retag; fix a bad release forward. Use before and after any tag, and when diagnosing a release that half-ran.

# Ship a release

Start read-only. Confirm the version and its plan (`/plan-release`), the exact source SHA
(on the default branch, reviewed, CI green), where it will be published, and your authority
to publish (your task or your human, with that scope). This skill grants no push, merge,
credential or protected-ref authority.

## Read the live release contract
Read what actually runs the release: the workflow, its scripts, and the project's release
docs or skill. The executable is the authority; where the docs disagree, record it rather
than improvise. Get a broken release step fixed in the project rather than worked around by
hand each release: a small workflow fix is release prep you may do yourself; anything
larger goes to the expert who owns the release tooling.

## Prepare
1. Pin the source SHA, this version's release notes, and the scope (artifacts, channels).
2. Work from a clean, isolated checkout of that SHA. Never reset a shared, dirty tree to
   make a gate pass.
3. Run the gates the release contract requires; record what ran and what didn't (a
   platform you can't build here, a manual acceptance step).

## Tag and publish
- Tag the exact SHA (annotated, if your project uses them), then let the release run as the
  contract says. A separately authorised publishing step needs that authority.
- Watch the release to its end; a pushed tag is not "released".

## Verify
Go through [references/verify-release.md](references/verify-release.md) item by item, and
report what you observed, with identifiers: versions, commits, digests, URLs. "No errors"
is not verification.

## Partial or failed publication
- Observe what was actually published (versions, their source commits, their contents)
  before choosing how to recover.
- Once the cause is fixed outside the tag (a credential, a runner), re-run only the failed
  step, from the same tag. Never retag; a fault in the tagged source ships fixed as the next
  version.
- A failed later step doesn't undo earlier publication. A retry that skips an
  already-published version doesn't prove that version came from this source: check it.
- Never delete or move a published tag, overwrite an immutable version, or cut a patch to
  hide an unknown partial outcome. Reconcile first; when identity or content is uncertain,
  stop and report.
- A same-name re-upload must match the reviewed artifacts byte for byte; a "replace" flag
  is not permission to replace unknown content.
- A credential fault goes to the human who owns the credential; runner and protected-ref
  faults go to your human or the operator.
- While publication is blocked, installing from the artifacts CI built is the human's call.
  If they choose it, say what differs: the registry and update checks still show the old
  latest version until publication. When publication later ships those same artifacts,
  nothing needs reinstalling.

## If the release is bad
A published release that breaks users is fixed forward, never rewritten:
- Stop the spread first: move the channel tag (`latest`, say) back to the last good
  version, or deprecate or yank the bad one where the registry allows, with a message
  saying what to use instead.
- Ship a fixed version quickly through the normal plan (`/plan-release`, as a hotfix).
- Tell the users and your human what broke, who is affected and what to do. Record it in
  your state, and a coherence rule if it can happen again.

## Close
Record the outcome under "Since the last sweep" in your state file. Tell those who must act
on it, once: whoever deploys it, the experts whose work waited on it, and your human, with
the version and what users must do. Publishing is not deploying: who adopts the release,
and when, is separate.
