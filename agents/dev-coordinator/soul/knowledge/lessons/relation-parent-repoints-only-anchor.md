# `--relation parent` re-points only the anchor's lineage

`oats spawn X --relation parent --relative-to "$OATS_INSTANCE"` re-points the
CALLING instance's recorded lineage so X becomes its parent (verified in
`lib/core.mjs` — "parent relation: re-point the ANCHOR's recorded lineage").
There is no flag that makes one spawn the parent of two existing instances at
once, and no standalone re-parent command surfaced in the CLI help.

So when two peer coordinators need a shared oats-expert arbiter as parent of
both: one coordinator spawns it with `--relation parent`, and the other must
be brought under it separately — by agreement between the coordinators or by
the expert instructing the peer. Soul guidance written for this (2026-07-26)
tells the spawner to state in the task brief that the expert oversees both
and that its ruling binds both.
