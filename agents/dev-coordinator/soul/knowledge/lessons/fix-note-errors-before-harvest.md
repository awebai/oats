# Lesson

In the terminal-fidelity delivery, maintainer review found two factual errors
in the developer's knowledge concepts (a dropped `-J` tmux flag still
documented, and a paste-normalization direction inverted). Because harvest
promotes notes verbatim into the soul, the coordinator relayed the nits with
an explicit instruction to fix them **before** running `oats okf harvest`.

Rule: when a review flags errors in notes/knowledge content, sequence the fix
ahead of the harvest in the wrap-up instructions.
