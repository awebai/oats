# Legacy resource spelling is not a safe package-format discriminator

Using the presence of deprecated `configs` to identify a legacy package and permit a `capabilities: ["."]` root looked convenient, but an immutable published package (`oats.authoring@1.0.0`) uses `.` and has no config resource at all. The optional spelling therefore cannot identify its format.

When no explicit format version exists, compatibility reading and new authoring validation are separate contracts:

- readers must continue accepting historical shapes independently of unrelated optional resources; and
- authoring tools/validators must reject emitting deprecated shapes.

A new canonical field can unambiguously signal the new format when present, but absence of both old and new optional fields cannot prove that a package is newly authored.
