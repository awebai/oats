# Global capability presence can block repo-scoped lock restoration

`restoreCapabilities(startDir)` walks each lockfile in the configuration chain, but checks presence with `capabilityManifest(id, startDir)`. That lookup spans the whole chain. A global artifact with the same capability ID can therefore make a repo-scoped lock report `present`, even when the repo-local artifact is missing and the global artifact has different integrity.

Observed while refreshing `oats.okf` after v0.18.2:

- repo lock required `oats.okf@1.4.0` with integrity `sha256-45c0cab49915fff18d97826bffb1cd0e4151e2930637744f707205dea4bc1499`;
- the existing repo-local store was stale, and `oats doctor` rejected it;
- after removing only the generated repo-local artifact, bare `oats install` reported the global `~/.agents/.../oats-okf` as `ok` instead of restoring the repo-local lock;
- `oats doctor` still failed because the global artifact's integrity differed from the repo lock.

The safe recovery was to call the normal `acquireCapability()` primitive directly for the repo scope with `expectIntegrity` set to the committed repo lock value. It reacquired the marketplace artifact into `~/oats/.agents/capabilities/installed/oats-okf`, verified exact integrity, and then `oats doctor . --json` passed.

A durable fix should make restore presence checks scope-specific: each lock level should be satisfied only by the artifact in that level's installed store, not by a same-ID artifact inherited from another configuration level.
