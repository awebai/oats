title: Retire developers without holding on docs-only follow-up PRs
description: A docs-only follow-up PR does not need its authoring developer alive — the coordinator can shepherd it and retire the instance once code is merged and notes are harvested.

# Lesson

During the oats.web terminal-fidelity delivery (PR #8), review left two
non-blocking doc nits fixed in a docs-only follow-up (PR #10). Holding the
developer instance alive just to await a docs-only merge wastes an instance:
once the feature is merged, the dev's memory protocol is complete (notes
harvested, branches deleted), the coordinator can take over shepherding the
follow-up PR with the maintainer and retire the developer immediately.

Precondition checklist before retiring: feature PR merged, harvest confirmed
("no pending notes"), local+remote branches deleted, dev reports task complete.
