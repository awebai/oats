# Lesson

When asked to build a new Active overview tab, first confirm whether the existing navigation surface already owns the destination. In the OATS desktop, `packages/desktop/renderer/views/hierarchy.mjs` is the nav item labeled "Active overview" and already implements the hard mechanics: deterministic tidy-tree forest from `parentInstance`, cycle-safe root promotion, pan/zoom/fit, per-node drag with live edges, lineage highlight, popover actions, keyboard tree-walk, and a 4s `/api/panel` poll gated by `workspaceGeneration()`.

# Design implication

Consistent with [Agent-centered desktop information architecture](/decisions/agent-centered-desktop-information-architecture.md), evolve the existing Active overview surface into the cluster-first design instead of shipping a second overview tab. Grep the nav (`shell.mjs` `NAV` array) before treating a requested "new tab" as a literally new destination.
