description: >-
  Use when editing a local OATS capability package and reinstalling or testing it
  in a deployment, when `oats install <capability-id>` did not pick up source
  changes, when a path-installed capability needs trust, or when manifest paths
  to bundled/hoisted skills disappear after acquisition.

# Reinstalling edited capability sources

When you edit `capabilities/<name>/` in this repo, do **not** reinstall by
capability ID and assume the checkout was used. `oats install <capability-id>`
resolves against the globally installed kernel's marketplace, not the working
tree, so it can silently re-lock the old published version.

## Procedure

1. Bump the capability `version` in `oats.json` for the edited capability; the
   lock records this value, and stale-version confusion is easy.
2. At the owning config level, remove the old lock entry and installed artifact:
   `oats-lock.json` plus `.agents/capabilities/installed/<name>`.
3. If the manifest references files outside the capability directory through a
   hoisted path (for example `node_modules/...` skills), copy that tree into
   the capability directory before acquisition. Path installs do not get the
   marketplace's hoisted-path resolution.
4. Install from the local path, not by ID:
   ```bash
   oats install /path/to/repo/capabilities/<name> [--dir <level>]
   ```
5. Trust the path-installed package at that scope:
   ```bash
   oats trust <id> --dir <level>
   ```
6. Remove any temporary copied-in hoisted tree after acquisition, then verify
   the lock/source/version and spawn or doctor the affected instance.

## Gotchas

- Path installs are not marketplace-trusted; forgetting `oats trust` leaves
  executable hooks/commands disabled.
- After linking a local framework checkout as the active CLI, `oats doctor` in
  each target deployment is the verifier. A layer may have a lock but no
  installed artifact; if bare restore refuses because the current marketplace
  bytes do not match the old lock integrity, remove only that stale lock entry,
  install from the explicit local package path, renew trust for the new
  integrity, and run doctor again. Do not bypass integrity checking.
- A manifest path that exists only in the globally installed package can make
  the capability appear installed while instances silently lose those skills.
- Reinstalling by ID after local edits usually proves only that the published
  marketplace copy still works.
