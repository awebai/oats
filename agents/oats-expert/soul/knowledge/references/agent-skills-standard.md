The Agent Skills standard (agentskills.io, Anthropic-originated; pi
implements it). Skill = directory with SKILL.md (frontmatter: `name` matching
dir, `description` ≤1024 chars carrying ALL triggering burden) + optional
scripts/, references/, assets/. Body ≤500 lines; progressive disclosure via
"read X when Y" references.

Creator guides distilled into our `skill-craft` packaged skill:
best-practices (ground in real expertise, gotchas sections, defaults not
menus, plan-validate-execute), optimizing-descriptions (trigger evals with
should-fire + near-miss prompts), evaluating-skills (with/without comparison),
using-scripts (bundle reinvented logic, self-correctable errors).

Companion: the agents.md standard ([concept](/references/agents-md-standard.md)).
