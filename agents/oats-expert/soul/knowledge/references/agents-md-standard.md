agents.md (OpenAI-originated, adopted by 60k+ projects and most major
harnesses): a predictable place for agent-facing context — commands, style,
workflow rules — complementing the human README.

Anthropic's CLAUDE.md guidance (claude-code best practices) matches: keep it
short, "would removing this cause mistakes?", commands not prose, prune when
rules get ignored, skills for on-demand domain knowledge.

OATS position: **AGENTS.md is canonical everywhere** (souls, instances,
workspace roots); `CLAUDE.md` is always a relative symlink to it, never an
independent file. Same for `.agents/skills` (canonical) vs `.claude/skills`
(symlink). Distilled into our `soul-craft` packaged skill.
