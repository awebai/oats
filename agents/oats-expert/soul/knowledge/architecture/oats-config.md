`<level>/oats-config.yaml` can exist at laptop, workspace, and repository
levels. Resolution starts in a soul's repository and walks outward. Config
owns deployment policy; packages own reusable artifacts. This guide implements
[capability packages](/decisions/capability-packages.md) as amended by
[config shape v2](/decisions/config-shape-agent-types-and-injections.md); the
CLI (`oats init` / `oats use` / `oats create --type`) is the primary config
author.

Agent types are families: config declares names (+ descriptions); each soul
opts in via a single optional `type: <name>` in its soul.yaml. Membership is
soul identity, not config policy. Targets are `global` (all souls governed by
that config level), an agent type, or one soul; specificity is
soul > type > global, then closer config level. Conflicts at equal
specificity and level error with provenance. Explicit false/exclusion follows
the same precedence.

A layer entry's capability manifest must declare that layer; a
layer-declaring capability under `additive` errors. A layer entry with no
explicit targets is globally enabled at its scope. An additive declaration
without targets is acquired but inactive. `capabilities.layers.<layer>: none`
suppresses an inherited integration; an absent slot inherits.

`from:` is doctor-enforced provenance documentation: the discovered artifact
origin (bundled / installed+locked / owned / path) must match.

Every injectable item (capability entry, work mode, `oats:` kernel block)
takes `injection-override: <path>|none|default`; scaffolded configs carry
commented lines pointing at the
`.agents/injections/{capabilities,workmodes,oats-defaults}/` conventions, and
`oats inject eject` materializes one (copy packaged default + set the key).
Overrides are rejected on `from: owned`/`path:` entries — the scope owns the
package source and edits its `injects/` file directly (see the
[authorship decision](/decisions/config-authorship-and-ambient-skills.md)).

# Runtime composition

Spawn resolves by soul name and repository, then materializes kernel + soul +
active capability skills exclusively into the instance's `.agents/skills`.
Duplicate names error unless `skill-overrides` identifies the source. Pi and
Claude consume this same directory; config/ancestor/package skill roots are
not runtime discovery surfaces.

Instance `AGENTS.md` is generated from canonical soul content plus kernel,
actual work mode, active capability, and unconditional config blocks. The
committed soul is never mutated by laptop/workspace/repo capability policy.
`oats doctor --soul <name>` uses the same composer and exposes final text and
provenance.

# Acquisition and trust

External packages are pinned in `<level>/oats-lock.json` by source, exact
version/commit, and integrity. Executable commands/hooks require explicit
trust for the locked integrity; declarative packages still require lock
integrity. Acquisition and activation are separate, and no resolver silently
updates a lock.

# Removed spellings

The v0.8 shapes — `groups:` with soul lists, top-level `layers:`, flat
`capabilities.<id>` maps, `source:`/`path:` capability keys, and
`agents-md-injection` as a per-item override — are rejected with pointed
migration errors, per the clean-contract precedent. The free-form top-level
`agents-md-injection:` map (additional blocks) remains. `oats use` re-serializes
the `capabilities:` block; custom comments inside it are not preserved.
