title: Terminal theme inference for TUIs
description: Control Pane should infer light or dark backgrounds from the terminal with OSC 11, fall back to COLORFGBG, and swap whole semantic palettes rather than isolated colors.

When implementing terminal theme inference for `oats pane`, treat the terminal as
the source of truth and keep rendering code theme-agnostic.

- **OSC 11** is the reliable query: write `\x1b]11;?\x07` with stdin in raw
  mode. Supporting terminals reply `\x1b]11;rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB` with 16-bit
  hex per channel; take the top byte. Some terminals emit 8-bit values.
  Compute relative luminance as `0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B`; values over
  `0.5` mean a light background.
- **Timeout is mandatory**: non-supporting terminals never reply. Use a short
  timeout around 150ms, then fall back to `COLORFGBG` by reading the background
  index from `fg;bg`; background index `7` or `15` means light. Default to dark
  if neither source answers.
- Run detection before entering the alt screen and main input loop, reusing the
  same raw-mode stdin that the TUI will own.
- Keep a single semantic color object (`ink`, `muted`, `faint`, surfaces, and
  related roles) and swap it wholesale through `applyTheme(light)`. Derived
  styles such as soul badge text and feature-branch chip foreground/background
  must be filled from the same semantic palette, not patched per color.
- Grep for hardcoded `38;2;` and `48;2;` literals outside the palette after
  theme work; a leaked branch-chip literal was unreadable on a light background.
- Keep `parseOsc11` exported and pure for testability. The frame renderer should
  not need theme awareness.
