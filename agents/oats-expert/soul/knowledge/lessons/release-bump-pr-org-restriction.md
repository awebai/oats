title: Release bump PR failure is an org-level Actions restriction
description: When tag-driven release publishing succeeds but the version-bump PR step fails with `Resource not accessible by integration`, the cause is the awebai org-level Actions restriction and the bump must be rescued manually.

During a release, the workflow's final create-and-merge version-bump PR step
can fail with `GraphQL: Resource not accessible by integration
(createPullRequest)`. That failure is not the repository-level "Allow GitHub
Actions to create and approve pull requests" toggle: in this repo that setting
is locked by the awebai organization policy. The repo API returned 409
"disabled by the organization", and changing the organization setting requires
an organization admin token with `admin:org` scope.

# The lesson

1. **Check publish state first.** The npm publishes complete before the bump-PR
   step. A bump-PR failure does not mean a broken release; verify with
   `npm view @awebai/oats version` before deciding whether to retag or
   rerun.
2. **Do not chase the repo toggle.** If the repo API says the Actions PR
   setting is disabled by the organization, only an organization admin can
   relax it.
3. **Rescue the bump PR manually while the org restriction remains:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head release-bump/vX.Y.Z \
     --title "release: vX.Y.Z version bump" --body "..."
   gh pr merge release-bump/vX.Y.Z --squash --delete-branch
   git pull   # bring the bump into the local checkout
   ```
4. **Related Pi install cleanup gotcha:** after installing a new
   `@awebai/oats-pi` version, `pi remove npm:@awebai/oats-pi@OLD` removes
   both settings entries because removal matches by package name, not by the
   full install spec. Reinstall the new version after any remove.
