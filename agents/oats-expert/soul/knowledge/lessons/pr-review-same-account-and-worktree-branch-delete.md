title: PR review friction — same-account review states and worktree-held branch deletion
description: In single-account deployments, maintainer approval or request-changes reviews may need to be recorded as PR comments, and branch deletion after merge may require deleting only the remote when another instance's worktree holds the local branch.

This affects the maintainer PR gate described in [OATS development team — PR-only flow, review capability, capability-defined agents, model preference lists](/decisions/dev-team-and-review-flow.md).

# Same-account review-state block

When the maintainer's `gh` authentication uses the same GitHub account that authored the PR, `gh pr review --approve` returns "Can not approve your own pull request" and `gh pr review --request-changes` hits the same GitHub block. This is common in single-account OATS deployments where all agents push as one identity. Record the APPROVE or RETURN verdict as a structured PR comment instead; merging still works for an APPROVE verdict. Observed on PRs #8, #10, #12, and #13 for approvals, and PR #14 round 2 for request-changes.

# Branch delete blocked by another instance's worktree

`gh pr merge --delete-branch` tries to delete the local branch as well as the remote. If a developer instance's worktree still has that branch checked out, the merge succeeds but local deletion fails with a "cannot delete branch ... used by worktree" error. Recover by deleting the remote branch with `git push origin --delete <branch>` and notifying the worktree owner to clean up their local branch.
