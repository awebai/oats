title: Init-time acquisition cannot rely on config-chain discovery
description: capabilityManifests only scans scopes that already have an oats-config.yaml, so oats init must use acquisition results directly before writing config.

While making `oats init` acquire marketplace layer capabilities, the package was
copied into `<dir>/.agents/capabilities/installed/` by `acquireCapability()`,
but a follow-up `capabilityManifest(id, dir)` returned undefined. Discovery
walks the config chain, and the scope's `oats-config.yaml` does not exist yet
at that point in init.

The fix was to trust the acquisition result (`{ ...r.manifest, _origin:
"installed:<dir>" }`) for the scaffold decision instead of re-discovering the
manifest. General rule: any command that acquires before writing config must
not round-trip through chain-based discovery in between.

A related migration-order gotcha: when a validation error blocks a config key
such as `from: bundled`, the migration message must be orderable. Because
`oats install` itself resolves the config chain, guidance must say to edit the
config first and then install; otherwise the error blocks its own remedy.
