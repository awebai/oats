# Repo state — the living picture

Maintenance contract: **whoever changes this reality updates this concept in
the same session** — a maintainer instance that merges a PR or cuts a release
appends here before retiring; the steward instance keeps it honest. Newest
entries first inside each section; prune entries that stop being true rather
than letting the file grow stale.

## On main

- **RELEASED v0.20.0 (2026-07-30)** — tag `v0.20.0` at `1e73257` published `@awebai/oats@0.20.0`, `@awebai/oats-pi@0.20.0`, and the complete Desktop 0.20.0 installer/checksum/provenance set. Release run `30548558607` passed build/test/tarball and all three Desktop build+smoke legs; its only failure was the known Actions-created-PR organization restriction after publication. Manual bump PR #68 merged as `c6d92da`, so main manifests are 0.20.0. Official package revisions, catalog follow-up, and local cutover are now authorized in that order.

- **PR #67 merged 2026-07-30 as `436b866`** — exact reviewed head `b519756` makes main tag-ready for the breaking v0.20.0 line: Desktop API remains v1 and accepts released CLI `>=0.18.0 <0.21.0`, with unit and real discovery-path edge coverage; grounded release notes record revised-v2 capability materialization, fully local templates, v1 whole-scope migration, unsupported transitional v2, release order, and backup/credential guidance. Full local gate, required CI, and all three installer verification legs passed; same-account approval comment `5131615861`; expected-head merge succeeded and remote branch was deleted. Tag publication is next; official package revisions/catalog follow only after the kernel release.

- **PR #66 merged 2026-07-30 as `dc30f0d`** — exact reviewed head `ecd1b41` replaces the transitional package-root v2 shape in place: packages are transient atomic transport/update units, capabilities materialize as flat self-contained versioned/trusted artifacts under gitignored `.agents/capabilities/installed`, optional `config-templates` become fully local editable configs with a committed adopted base and byte-preserving diff/sync/reset/adopt, classic init is catalog-first/untrusted, and v1 migration is whole-scope atomic with no residue. One terminal review RETURN at `b189fcb` closed seven demonstrated filesystem/config/provenance/rollback issues in one bounded pass. Final gates and exact-head CI passed; same-account approval comment `5131055219`; expected-head merge succeeded and the remote branch was deleted. Not yet released: a bounded Desktop API v1 compatibility-band/release-note follow-up must precede v0.20.0, then official packages/catalog and local cutover.

- **RELEASED v0.19.4 (2026-07-28)** — official distribution packages, config-profile snapshots, lock v2, contained `oats-package/` payload roots, guided 0.18 migration, consented runtime requirements, strict OATS-managed instance curricula, canonical primary-checkout homes, official catalog/redirects, and the specialist-agent README are published as `@awebai/oats@0.19.4`, `@awebai/oats-pi@0.19.4`, and the complete Desktop installer matrix. Release run `30396340346` passed all code/package/clean-room/Desktop artifact gates; its only failure was the known Actions permission block after publication. Manual bump PR #65 merged as `9131b83`. The six official package repositories are independently tagged/released; `oats.dev@1.0.0` is the complete editable non-Git workspace profile, and each package repository now owns a durable package-maintainer soul. Local released-runtime install, package reconciliation, Pi/Claude composition, aweb root, and cross-repository spawn/retire probes passed.

- **PR #58 merged 2026-07-28 as `ab51acc`** — guided existing-user migration builds on the existing transactional engine: `oats migrate --official --recursive` plans outer/team/nested lock scopes, uses catalog capability aliases (including `oats.review`→`oats.dev`), preserves config bytes and custom/owned/path entries, holds unmapped official scopes unchanged, never transfers trust, and reports exact trust/install follow-ups with stable JSON and doctor readiness. Multi-capability package conversion and held dry-run exit truthfulness were fixed before terminal APPROVE. Independent detached clean room passed 865 tests (864 pass/0 fail/1 environment skip), all checks/strict seven-bundle OKF/pack/smoke/diff; required exact-head CI passed; approval comment `5107558430`; expected-head merge succeeded and remote branch was deleted. The installed `oats.authoring` hoisted-resource anchor defect remains a separate active release blocker.

- **PR #57 merged 2026-07-28 as `d9e176f`** — Git/catalog package sources now select a configurable contained payload path; the official/default convention is `oats-package/`, custom paths and explicit root are supported, and direct local package roots retain exact-directory semantics. Lock v2 strictly records canonical `path`; acquisition clones one exact commit and installs/hashes only the selected subtree; bare restore keeps the locked path while only explicit update may advance it. Local owned/path capabilities are unchanged. Review rounds closed catalog-path loss, pinned-ref drift, lock-source kind reclassification, intermediate broken/escaping links, Git ref option injection, and remote-branch DWIM regression. Terminal product head `bc11a02` was APPROVE; exact PR head `842f043` adds semantically current knowledge only. Full local gate = 853/0 plus all checks; exact-head CI passed; approval comment `5106896683`; expected-head merge succeeded and remote branch was deleted. A merged-source scaffold-only child probe then verified canonical primary home placement, AGENTS/CLAUDE and skill aliases, exact kernel+targeted capability curriculum, Claude/Opus runtime posture, lineage metadata, and clean worktree/branch retirement. Existing-user v1 migration remains a separate immediate follow-up.

- **PR #47 merged 2026-07-26 as `6f8dbf1`** — knowledge-only oats-desktop-engineer split-ui post-merge harvest preservation. It carries retiring `oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui`'s final harvest commit (`44b019f`, cherry-picked as exact PR head `42c35ec`) into the canonical Desktop soul: maintainer mergeability loops now emphasize live PR head verification, rebasing only onto explicitly mailed successor SHAs, hold discipline while a wait instruction stands, self-contained handbacks, newest-first `log.md` union conflicts, fresh fetch before PR opening, and gating mechanical stewardship/rebase commits. Final gates passed: source-state comparison showed only that Desktop-soul harvest not on main and byte-identical touched files, targeted Desktop strict OKF `110/0/0`, aggregate strict OKF all 8 bundles with zero warnings, scratch `npm test` `568/569` with the expected node-pty skip, `check`, `validate`, `pack:check`, diff-check, and exact-head PR CI. Same-account approval is PR comment `5085072697`; expected-head merge succeeded, and the remote harvest branch was deleted manually after the detached scratch worktree prevented `gh pr merge --delete-branch` from determining a current branch. No product, release, manifest, package, or framework behavior changes.

- **PR #44 merged 2026-07-26 as `479e8b5`** — Desktop split/sidebar UI completion follow-up to PR #41. Adds visible sidebar restore/toggle buttons and tab-strip split controls that dispatch through context-gated registered actions, proves splits seed from the active terminal tab, and aligns split member tabs in a dedicated full-width pane row by moving the real tab elements into per-pane groups while non-member tabs/controls stay below. Final exact head `f9e9ebb` passed prior full scratch gates plus final exact-head PR CI and all three installer checks after six mergeability-only RETURNs caused by concurrent stewardship/PR #45/#46 main movement. Same-account approval is PR comment `5085035759`; expected-head merge succeeded, and the remote feature branch was deleted manually after `gh pr merge --delete-branch` tripped on detached scratch branch detection. Post-merge scaffold-only child probe `oats-expert-pr44-probe` verified AGENTS/CLAUDE, soul/work links, memory scaffolding, real skills, child relation metadata, `launched:false`, and clean retirement. Not yet released.

- **PR #46 merged 2026-07-26 as `83ce16f`** — knowledge-only oats-desktop-engineer post-PR45 harvest. It preserves the maintainer-handback stewardship-race lesson and links it from crossed-mail coordination: named handback bases are minimums once `origin/main` advances, stale verdicts get one evidence-backed reply, explicit stop/hold instructions still win, and stewardship-only merge commits still receive the root gate. Final exact head `2551f1d` passed semantic review, scratch `npm test` 557/558 with the expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `validate`, `pack:check`, strict OKF for all 8 bundles with zero warnings (Desktop 108/0/0), diff-check, and exact-head CI. Same-account approval is PR comment `5085013285`; expected-head merge succeeded and the remote harvest branch is deleted. No product, release, manifest, package, or framework behavior changes.

- **PR #45 merged 2026-07-26 as `6f35e9e`** — Desktop post-spawn terminal handoff now waits for actual terminal readiness (`running && tmux.session`) under the existing ownership/composite-identity guards, closes the completed modal, degrades safely on timeout, and contains the whole quiet auto-open async flow so automated failures warn instead of blocking or escaping as unhandled rejections. Final exact head `9c4e995` passed the full local/scratch history and all four exact-head checks after four mergeability-only RETURNs caused by delayed crossed mail and concurrent stewardship moving main. Same-account approval is PR comment `5084986482`; remote branch deleted, owner retains local cleanup. Scaffold-only child probe `oats-expert-pr45-probe` verified expected layout, real skills, child relation metadata, no launch, and clean retirement. Not yet released.

- **PR #42 merged 2026-07-26 as `09605c7`** — knowledge-only oats-desktop-engineer quick-open harvest preservation. It carries the retiring `oats-desktop-engineer-quick-open` post-merge memory-harvest commit (`97654ce`, cherry-picked as exact PR head `028a984`) into the canonical soul: deferred module-level Quick Open preselects now explicitly die with the mounted Spawn consumer on unmount, updating both the pending-intent data-currency lesson and the Quick Open → Spawn preselect handoff decision. Final gates passed: targeted Desktop strict OKF `106/0/0`, aggregate strict OKF all 8 bundles with zero warnings, scratch `npm test` `554/555` with the expected node-pty skip after root + Desktop dependency install and copied installed capabilities, `check`, `validate`, `pack:check`, diff-check, and exact-head PR CI. Same-account approval was recorded as a comment; the remote harvest branch is deleted. No product, release, manifest, package, or framework behavior changes.

- **PR #41 merged 2026-07-26 as `c055614`** — Desktop terminal tabs now support bounded side-by-side and stacked split panes with existing tab identity/dedup, pane-level selection, adjacent-member close fallback, resize refits, editable shortcuts, and a pending-slot model kept in parity with the renderer. The sidebar is hideable with a persisted shortcut; non-mac `Ctrl+B` remains tmux-owned. Final exact head `2ff4792`; scratch gates, strict OKF for all 8 bundles, PR CI, and all three installer checks passed. Same-account approval was recorded as a comment; the remote feature branch is deleted, while local cleanup remains with the worktree at `/private/tmp/integrate-split-panels`. Not yet released.

- **PR #40 merged 2026-07-26 as `3da7ce8`** — Desktop Quick Open for souls (`Mod+P`) and terminal focus on user-initiated jumps. Adds shared overlay-picker machinery, fixes the palette fuzzy scorer's negative-prefix no-match bug, routes soul selection through Spawn's consumed-once `preselectSoul()` handoff, keeps `Ctrl+P` in Linux/Windows terminals shell-owned, and makes terminal content focus explicit via `activateTab(id, { focusContent })` plus a chordless `terminal.focusActive` action. Final exact head `9d00985`; scratch gates, strict OKF for all 8 bundles, PR CI, and all three installer verify jobs passed. Same-account approval was recorded as a comment; the remote feature branch is deleted. Not yet released.

- **RELEASED v0.18.6 (2026-07-26)** — tag `v0.18.6` on release-notes/stewardship commit `0dd7878`, containing PR #38 agent relations and PR #35 editable keybindings. Published `@awebai/oats@0.18.6` + `@awebai/oats-pi@0.18.6` and GitHub Release v0.18.6 with all six Desktop installers, SHA256SUMS.txt, and build provenance. Release run `30198186842` passed build/test and macOS arm64/x64 plus Linux x64 installer build+smoke; its only failure was the known org-policy block on Actions-created PRs after publication. Manifests were bumped through manual rescue PR #39 (`9fc7c0e`). The published kernel passed syntax checks and a clean create→root-qualified child relation spawn→metadata/layout inspect→retire probe; canonical soul content stayed unchanged.

- **PR #38 merged 2026-07-26 as `dfa0ac0`** — explicit child/sibling/parent/unrelated spawn relations across kernel, CLI, and Desktop; ambiguity-safe root-qualified anchors; attached child-of-owner semantics; retirement splice repair; composite instance identity; cluster-first Active/sidebar surfaces; and a relation-aware spawn modal. The merge preserves PR #35 editable keybindings and PR #36 knowledge, with reviewed fixes for composite roster parent focus, hierarchy Brain selection, and modal shortcut ownership. Final exact head `4bbfe8d`; all local, strict OKF, PR CI, and three installer checks passed after two RETURNs. The remote feature branch is deleted. Scaffold-only child-relation probe `oats-expert-pr38-probe` verified expected layout, real skill directories, relation metadata, no launch, and clean retirement. The [spawn-relations decision](/decisions/spawn-relations-live-lineage.md) records the human-accepted no-journal/lease limitations. Released exactly as v0.18.6.

- **PR #36 merged 2026-07-25 as `032c7a3`** — knowledge-only oats-desktop-engineer post-PR35 keybindings harvests. Preserves both keybindings developers' stranded post-merge harvests: dispatch-ineligible view-action semantics, crossed-mail coordination, PR35 follow-up queues, modal focus restoration, and the DEFAULT_KEYMAP/defaultChord split plus terminal allowlist delivery follow-ups. Final exact head `1e9980f`; all local gates, strict OKF for all 8 bundles, PR CI, and mergeability passed after two maintainer RETURNs. The remote `harvest/keybindings-wiring` branch is deleted; local branch cleanup is blocked by another worktree at `/private/tmp/harvest-wiring`. No product, release, manifest, package, or framework behavior changes.

- **PR #35 merged 2026-07-25 as `7f1e5a7`** — Desktop user-editable
  keyboard shortcuts for all panel actions. Adds a central keybinding engine
  with localStorage overrides and sanitized explicit unbinds, a `Mod+,`
  shortcuts editor, action-id terminal allowlist interception before PTY writes,
  rebindable app/stage/tab/sidebar/terminal typography/view-local actions,
  full keyboard operation for roster/spawn/hierarchy surfaces, live chord labels
  and tooltips, and renderer syntax coverage. Final exact head `039458f`; all
  local gates, strict OKF for all 8 bundles, PR CI, and macOS arm64/x64 plus
  Linux x64 installer verify checks passed after two maintainer RETURNs. The
  remote feature branch is deleted; local branch cleanup is blocked by another
  worktree at `/private/tmp/integrate-keybindings`. Post-merge scaffold-only
  probe `oats-expert-pr35-probe` created the expected instance layout (AGENTS.md,
  CLAUDE.md, instance.json, STATE/log/notes, soul/work symlinks, .agents and
  .aw scaffolding) with `launched:false`, then retired cleanly. Released in
  v0.18.6.

- **RELEASED v0.18.5 (2026-07-25)** — corrective Desktop patch containing
  PR #32 and PR #33. Tag `v0.18.5` on `a0052bd` (both corrective merges plus
  release notes). Published `@awebai/oats@0.18.5` +
  `@awebai/oats-pi@0.18.5` and GitHub Release v0.18.5 with all six Desktop
  installers, SHA256SUMS.txt, and build provenance. Release run `30160666617`
  passed build/test and macOS arm64/x64 plus Linux x64 installer build+smoke;
  its only failure was the known org-policy block on Actions-created PRs after
  publication. Manifests were bumped through manual rescue PR #34 (`8f5af90`).
  The published kernel passed a clean create→spawn→inspect→retire deployment
  probe; this machine's global kernel and Pi bridge were updated to 0.18.5 with
  clean OATS and LFX doctors. Per coordinator instruction, running Desktop app
  processes were not touched.

- **PR #33 merged 2026-07-25 as `595159e`** — fixes both remaining v0.18.4
  terminal field failures: Shift+Enter suppresses xterm keydown/keypress/keyup
  while writing one newline, and modifier-forced local xterm selection enables
  terminal copy with tmux mouse mode (Option on macOS, Shift on non-macOS).
  Final exact head `d75fa3a`; human live verification, local full/affected
  gates, strict OKF, required CI, and all three installer checks passed after
  two maintainer RETURNs. Released with PR #32 in v0.18.5; v0.18.4 remains
  immutable.

- **PR #32 merged 2026-07-25 as `97f66c9`** — corrective rollback for the
  out-of-scope PR #29 Instances rail destination and second roster sidebar.
  The shell again exposes only Active overview and Soul roster as stages; the
  permanent sidebar remains the instances context. The deleted stage/view,
  tests, docs, and 104 lines of stage-only CSS are gone, with absence pins;
  shared grouping helpers remain for separately owned sidebar work. Final exact
  head `69641c9`; full local gate, human live workspace test, independent
  reviewer, required CI, and all three installer checks passed. Released in
  v0.18.5; immutable v0.18.4 artifacts remain unchanged.

- **RELEASED v0.18.4 (2026-07-25)** — Desktop UX fixes from PR #29. Tag
  `v0.18.4` on `a84443a` (PR #29 merge plus release notes). Published
  `@awebai/oats@0.18.4` + `@awebai/oats-pi@0.18.4` and GitHub Release
  v0.18.4 with all six Desktop installers (mac arm64/x64 DMG+ZIP, Linux x64
  AppImage+DEB), SHA256SUMS.txt, and build provenance. Build/test and all three
  installer build+smoke legs passed in release run `30158015741`; the run's
  only failure was the known org-policy block on Actions-created PRs after
  publication. Manifests were bumped to 0.18.4 through manual rescue PR #31
  (`fda7498`). The published kernel passed a clean create→spawn→inspect→retire
  deployment probe and reported Desktop API v1 at version 0.18.4. A human
  subsequently identified an out-of-scope Desktop navigation regression in
  PR #29. Corrective source landed in PR #32; v0.18.4 remains immutable and a
  new patch release is required (see open threads).

- **PR #29 merged 2026-07-25 as `b7203eb`** — Desktop UX fixes: spawn view
  retries an unsettled CLI probe with truthful pending UI; Shift+Enter inserts
  a newline and transcripts are copyable without Linux/Windows Ctrl-chord
  regressions; Instances is a first-class nav/palette stage with repo→family
  grouping, collapsible headers, and workspace-scoped sorting; active terminal
  tabs restore per workspace. Final exact head `9736852`; all PR and three-leg
  installer checks green. Released in v0.18.4.

- **PR #30 merged 2026-07-25 as `935d142`**: post-v0.18.3 knowledge-only
  harvest from cli-dev and oats-desktop-engineer. Promotes the corrected macOS
  installer signing/release lessons, strict codesign gate structure, release
  workflow/static-test gotchas, and a read-only aweb trust-mismatch diagnostic
  skill. No product, release, manifest, or framework behavior changes.

- **RELEASED v0.18.3 (2026-07-25)** — corrected macOS installers. Tag `v0.18.3`
  on PR #27 merge commit `921f44a`. Published `@awebai/oats@0.18.3` +
  `@awebai/oats-pi@0.18.3` (npm latest) and GitHub Release v0.18.3 with all
  six Desktop installers (mac arm64/x64 DMG+ZIP, linux x64 AppImage+DEB) +
  SHA256SUMS.txt + build provenance. Fixes the v0.18.2 defect: both mac `.app`
  bundles now carry COMPLETE ad-hoc signatures (identity `"-"`, NOT Developer ID,
  NOT notarized) and pass strict deep codesign, gated fail-closed in CI on both
  arches (external step + unconditional packaged smoke, byte-identical
  run-blocks). Manifests on main bumped to 0.18.3 via manual bump PR #28
  (`9a6eae8`) — the release run's own bump-PR create step is blocked by org
  policy (see open threads). v0.18.2 assets untouched. Operator to manually
  launch-test the released arm64 artifact.

- **PR #27 merged 2026-07-25 as `921f44a`**: publish valid ad-hoc-signed macOS
  installers (electron-builder `identity: "-"`; strict deep codesign gate as
  external workflow step + unconditional darwin smoke; release-notes existence
  gate; `CSC_FOR_PULL_REQUEST=true` on build-installers only). Drove v0.18.3.

- **PR #26 merged 2026-07-25 as `0061eb5`**: knowledge-only — promoted the
  detached-HEAD release refspec lesson
  (`agents/cli-dev/soul/knowledge/lessons/exact-tag-detached-head-refspec.md`)
  into the canonical cli-dev soul, harvested from PR #25's fix. No code change.

- **PR #25 merged 2026-07-25 as `8d7d2ee`**: release.yml bump-PR push ref
  fully-qualified to `HEAD:refs/heads/${BRANCH}` (detached-HEAD safe) + a
  regression guard in test/release-workflow.test.mjs. Fixes the recurring
  bump-PR push failure; no retag/republish (v0.18.2 stays complete).

- **RELEASED v0.18.2 (2026-07-25)** — first public OATS Desktop release.
  Tag `v0.18.2` on merge commit `7cc3b5b`. Published: `@awebai/oats@0.18.2`
  + `@awebai/oats-pi@0.18.2` (npm latest), and GitHub Release v0.18.2 with all
  Desktop installers (mac arm64/x64 DMG+ZIP, linux x64 AppImage+DEB), SHA256SUMS
  + build provenance (UNSIGNED/not notarized — no signing secrets). desktopApi:1
  contract verified on the PUBLISHED artifact. Source manifests bumped to 0.18.2
  (root/pi/desktop) via manually-rescued bump PR #24. Delivered by PR #21 (the
  Electron app + legacy-panel succession, merged `0961175`) + PR #22 (Linux
  executableName release-blocker fix, merged `7cc3b5b`). Superseded the failed
  `v0.18.1` cut (Linux desktop-build failed, nothing published; tag deleted).

- PR #19 merged 2026-07-24 as `9b39ee7`: OATS Desktop private package took over
  the panel backend; oats.web, `oats pane`, and the public control-pane export
  retired with migration diagnostics; explicit spawn lineage/task delivery +
  traversal-safe shared instance lookup. (Its "release still blocked on installer
  distribution" caveat is now RESOLVED by v0.18.2.)

- 2026-07-23 reviewer-deaths incident fixes (direct commits, incident
  response): b3eeed0 — retireInstance tmux kill-window targets `=`-anchored
  (tmux targets prefix-match; test fixture "reviewer-1" was killing live
  reviewer-15c135c* windows); 0753b40 — `npm test` pinned to explicit globs
  (bare `node --test` recursed into agents/*/instances/*/work sibling
  checkouts, re-running stale unfixed suites) + CLI-subprocess spawn/retire
  tests export PI_AGENTS_TMUX_SESSION=oats-test-nosuch.

- Earlier oats.web and Control Pane deliveries remain in the delivery log and
  donor-soul knowledge as migration history; their product surfaces are no
  longer present on main.
- Framework source and Desktop artifacts are now **0.19.4** (root/pi npm plus
  GitHub Release installers). Official package tags are: oats.okf 1.4.1,
  oats.aweb 1.8.0, oats.authoring/oats.jira/oats.linear/oats.dev 1.0.0; `oats.dev`
  exports oats.review 1.2.0.

## In flight

- **Post-v0.20 official package and local cutover** — framework v0.20.0 is published; `dev-coordinator-capability-finalization` owns dedicated-root/config-template revisions and immutable releases for all six official packages (leaf packages first, `oats.dev` last), catalog follow-up, normal global npm/Pi installation, supported local workspace rebuild (no transitional-v2 migration), three-workspace source Desktop restart, and safe branch/worktree cleanup. The five leaf instances are live on unchanged clean launch bases after bounded recovery from Claude trust/onboarding prompt exits; the coordinator checkout is restored, and package work is in progress. `oats.dev` and catalog remain frozen until the five leaf tags are immutable. No credential deletion or old-v2 compatibility subsystem.
- Historical open PRs #37, #43, and #48 remain outside this feature scope and require separate owner decisions.

## Open threads

- aweb channel awakening drops (2 consecutive repros 2026-07-23): verdict
  mail from short-lived reviewer identities delivered and marked READ
  server-side but no awakening injected into the recipient's idle session —
  visible only via `aw mail inbox --show-all`. RESOLVED-as-characterized 2026-07-23: intermittent ~30-min
  delay when the recipient session is mid-turn (2 delayed while busy, 2
  prompt while idle); no drops observed. Reported to the human by
  tui-dev-desktop-shell. Triage: check `aw mail inbox --show-all` before
  assuming a retired sender died. Two data points at a consistent ~30-min
  offset (10:16→~10:4x, 10:23→~10:5x) suggest a fixed-period flush; operator
  report filed by tui-dev-desktop-shell with message-ids and timestamps.
  Fleet-facing lessons also promoted into tui-dev's soul knowledge. Escalated to the human operator via
  tui-dev-desktop-shell; triage guidance: window-gone + no-event now most
  likely means completed-but-event-dropped, check `--show-all` and the
  session log tail.
- Sibling agent worktrees predate the b3eeed0/0753b40 fixes; until they
  merge main, `npm test` run from THOSE roots can still prefix-kill live
  reviewer-* windows (owners notified via tui-dev thread).

- CI bump-PR step: the ambiguous-refspec failure is **RESOLVED on main** by
  PR #25 (`8d7d2ee`) and **confirmed on the v0.18.3 run** (push logged
  `[new branch] HEAD -> release-bump/v0.18.3`). The REMAINING cause is
  org-level: `gh pr create` fails `GraphQL: Resource not accessible by
  integration (createPullRequest)` because the awebai org policy blocks
  Actions-created PRs. Every tag-driven release therefore ends with a
  conclusion=failure run whose ONLY failed step is the bump-PR create; npm +
  GitHub Release already succeeded (never retag). Rescue each time: create +
  squash-merge the `release-bump/vX.Y.Z` branch manually (done for v0.18.3 as
  PR #28, v0.18.4 as PR #31, v0.18.5 as PR #34, and v0.18.6 as PR #39). Needs an org admin to
  relax the Actions-PR policy to fully automate.
  Rescue procedure is in the git-tag-release skill.
- Published artifacts are now v0.19.4. The macOS installers retain complete
  ad-hoc signatures passing strict deep codesign; earlier release assets remain
  untouched.
- webpanel-dev instance worktrees still hold deleted branches locally
  (webpanel-dev-1: feature/panel-refinements, fix/panel-key-routing,
  perf/fast-attach, debug/typing-live; webpanel-dev-spawn-from-panel:
  agents/webpanel-dev-spawn-from-panel — owners notified to clean up).
