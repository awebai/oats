Append-only, newest first. Every per-PR maintainer instance appends ONE entry
before retiring — merge or return, always. Format:

```
## PR #<n> — <one-line scope> (<date>)
- verdict: MERGED | RETURNED (+ short why per failed gate) | CLOSED
- owner: <instance> · coordinator: <instance or none>
- taught us: <anything the review revealed — codebase gotcha, process gap,
  decision that needs recording — or "nothing new">
```

Entries whose lessons grow beyond a line get promoted to lessons/ or

## PR #68 — v0.20.0 manifest bump after complete publication (2026-07-30)
- verdict: MERGED as `c6d92da04b6c06c4da2987790d423e8b736744dd` from exact automated head `3f6805ec142537276b9a3c305ace10295adc8434`. Release run `30548558607` had already passed build/test/tarball, all three Desktop installer build+smoke legs, npm publication of OATS/Pi 0.20.0, checksums/provenance, and GitHub Release creation; only the known organization policy blocked Actions from creating its version-bump PR. Maintainer created and squash-merged the rescue PR manually.
- owner: oats-expert-oats-packages · coordinator: dev-coordinator-capability-finalization
- taught us: nothing new beyond the existing org-level Actions PR restriction; publication is complete before this expected failure, so rescue the immutable manifest bump without retagging.

## PR #67 — v0.20.0 Desktop compatibility and release readiness (2026-07-30)
- verdict: MERGED as `436b86641ed7158d6d69e995ef8565479b96881d` at exact reviewed/API head `b5197563f078821efa543c5644396931cf1c5fb4`. The bounded follow-up keeps Desktop API v1 while widening the one authoritative CLI band to `>=0.18.0 <0.21.0`, pins unit and real discovery-path edges, updates the Desktop contract, and adds grounded v0.20.0 notes covering revised-v2 materialization, local config templates, scope-atomic v1 migration, release ordering, backups, and no credential cleanup. Exact local gate passed 892 total/891 pass/0 fail/1 skip plus all checks/strict OKF/pack/tarball/diff; required CI and all three verify-only installer matrix legs passed. Same-account approval is comment `5131615861`; expected-head merge succeeded and remote branch was deleted.
- owner: dev-coordinator-capability-finalization · coordinator: oats-expert-oats-packages
- taught us: a breaking kernel line can retain the Desktop API version while still requiring an explicit semver-band release gate; the app must always admit the matching kernel built from its own tag, with both unit and real discovery-path edge tests.

## PR #66 — capability materialization and fully local config templates (2026-07-30)
- verdict: MERGED as `dc30f0d1df7ea8e78df9fa5486857e77f33cfce5` at exact reviewed/API head `ecd1b41b3a47b188febe508a37874b4985b05ba4`. Direction/correctness/security/mergeability PASS after one merged-state RETURN at `b189fcb` and one bounded correction: revised lock v2 materializes self-contained capabilities under gitignored `.agents/capabilities/installed`; package staging is transient; config templates are optional fully editable local bases with byte-preserving diff/sync/reset/adopt; v1 migration is scope-atomic; classic init is catalog-first and untrusted. The correction closed capability-ID path traversal, adopted/backup symlink escapes, silent handcrafted-config replacement, same-package scope provenance, swap/export rollback, canonical template roots, and pre-staging ignore. Final evidence: affected 198/198, B1/B2/B3 PASS, 890 total/889 pass/0 fail/1 environment skip, all check/validate/pack/tarball/strict-OKF/diff gates, and required exact-head CI success. Same-account approval is comment `5131055219`; expected-head merge succeeded and remote feature branch was deleted.
- owner: dev-coordinator-capability-materialization · coordinator: oats-expert-oats-packages
- taught us: a distribution package can remain the atomic source/update boundary while installed capability artifacts are the inspectable trust units; config adoption needs a committed base and byte-preserving three-way semantics, and filesystem transaction claims must include path-derived IDs, symlinked write parents, generated-ignore timing, and every backup/swap boundary.

## PR #65 — v0.19.4 manifest bump after complete publication (2026-07-28)
- verdict: MERGED as `9131b83c368296458ae50efac1d8af531fd1521b` from exact release-bump head `06f2256674694dc93453011a0ff54a2013bc1414`. The v0.19.4 release had already published `@awebai/oats`, `@awebai/oats-pi`, checksums/provenance, and the complete Desktop installer matrix after all build/test/smoke gates passed in run `30396340346`; only the known organization policy prevented Actions from creating the version-bump PR, so the maintainer created and squash-merged it manually.
- owner: oats-expert-oats-packages · coordinator: none
- taught us: repository deployment config must not be an implicit test fixture. Moving the official package closure to a non-Git workspace exposed two Desktop tests that relied on the former repository lock; explicit isolated fixtures and ephemeral loopback ports now keep the release gate independent of operator deployment state.

## PR #58 — guided official-capability migration for existing 0.18 deployments (2026-07-28)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `ab51acc8ec4381fac1b75d569b1225a8e6482f56` at exact head `24e6f00a7fe35a0cd88e32646ab251bdc83433be`. All four gates PASS. The new `oats migrate --official --recursive` is a guided policy layer over the existing transactional migration engine: deterministic outer/team/nested scope planning, catalog-driven capability→package aliases, config-byte preservation, held/unmapped official scopes left unchanged, custom/owned/path entries retained, per-scope truthful aggregate failure, no trust transfer, and exact trust/install next commands. Reviewer returned two important findings—multiple legacy capabilities exported by one package collided during conversion, and a held dry-run exited success—and approved the exact fixes; the final delta was knowledge only. Fresh detached clean room with root/Desktop/Pi dependencies passed 865 tests (864 pass, 0 fail, 1 environment skip), check/check:pi/validate, strict seven-bundle OKF zero warnings, pack, tarball smoke and diff-check; required exact-head CI passed. Same-account approval is comment `5107558430`; expected-head merge succeeded and remote branch was deleted.
- owner: cli-dev-official-capability-migration · coordinator: oats-expert-oats-packages (direct)
- taught us: a guided migration readiness dry-run must fail when held, not merely display a warning; package aliases create the real multi-capability-provider case, so all converted residue entries must leave together and one package source must be acquired once. Existing configuration identity can remain byte-stable when replacement packages export the same capability IDs.

## PR #57 — configurable contained OATS package payload roots (2026-07-28)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `d9e176f4b57a9c9e25f69d35b98046cc19267d6e` at exact PR head `842f0433311c766097c4eb3b1d4514b2ee0efd90`. All four gates PASS. Git/catalog sources select an authoritative configurable package `path`; omitted Git/catalog path defaults to the official `oats-package/` convention, custom paths and explicit root work, while local paths remain exact package roots. Lock v2 records strict canonical path provenance; one exact checkout is fetched and only the selected subtree is installed/hashed; bare restore uses locked source+commit+path and only explicit update advances it. Existing `from: owned`, `from: path`, and legacy capability semantics remain separate. Four review rounds closed real catalog/path/ref/source parsing and containment findings, including source-kind reclassification, Git option injection, pinned-ref mismatch, broken intermediate links, and remote-branch DWIM restoration. Terminal product head `bc11a02` received APPROVE/no findings; the only later delta was semantically reviewed cli-dev knowledge. Local full gate passed 853 tests/0 failures plus check/check:pi/validate/warning-free strict OKF/pack/smoke/diff; required exact-head CI passed. Same-account approval is comment `5106896683`; expected-head merge succeeded and remote branch was deleted. A merged-source scaffold-only child probe verified canonical home, AGENTS/CLAUDE and skills aliases, selected curriculum/provenance, Claude/Opus posture, child lineage and clean worktree/branch retirement.
- owner: cli-dev-package-payload-root · coordinator: oats-expert-oats-packages (direct)
- taught us: a repository source and its installed package are separate boundaries; explicit payload selection prevents owner souls and development files from entering integrity. Argv execution alone does not prevent option injection, persisted source strings must be validated against the writer grammar before re-parsing, and replacing Git porcelain with plumbing requires intentionally restoring wanted DWIM behavior.

## PR #47 — oats-desktop-engineer split-ui maintainer hold-discipline harvest (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `6f8dbf1` at exact head `42c35ec`. All four gates PASS. The knowledge-only delta preserves retiring `oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui`'s post-merge harvest commit (`44b019f`, cherry-picked as `42c35ec`) in the canonical Desktop soul: the maintainer mergeability-loop lesson now emphasizes live PR head verification, one evidence-backed reply to stale verdicts, rebasing only onto the explicitly mailed successor SHA, holding instead of speculatively rebasing while a wait instruction stands, self-contained handbacks, newest-first `log.md` conflict union, fresh fetch before PR opening, and gating mechanical rebase/stewardship commits. Source-state review showed `origin/main..44b019f -- agents/oats-desktop-engineer/soul/knowledge` contains only that harvest and the touched Desktop-soul files are byte-identical between source `44b019f` and PR head. Fresh scratch gates passed after root + Desktop dependency install and copied installed capabilities: targeted oats-desktop-engineer strict OKF `110 concept(s), 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)`, aggregate `validate:okf` all 8 bundles with zero warnings, `npm test` `568/569` with the expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `validate`, `pack:check`, and diff-check. Exact-head PR CI was green; same-account approval is PR comment `5085072697`; expected-head merge succeeded, and the remote harvest branch was deleted manually after the detached scratch worktree blocked automatic branch deletion.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui · coordinator: none
- taught us: nothing new beyond the existing post-merge harvest rules — compare source harvest branch state, inspect per-bundle strict OKF output, and semantically read the changed/linked concepts before preserving a stranded terminal harvest.

## PR #46 — oats-desktop-engineer maintainer-handback stewardship-race harvest (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `83ce16f` at exact head `2551f1d`. All four gates PASS. The knowledge-only delta adds the universal maintainer-handback stewardship-race lesson, cross-links it from crossed-mail coordination, and updates the Desktop soul index/log. Semantic review confirmed the guidance matches PR #45's terminal evidence and preserves explicit STOP/hold precedence. Detached scratch gates passed `npm test` 557/558 with one expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `validate`, `pack:check`, diff-check, and strict OKF for all 8 bundles with zero warnings (changed Desktop bundle 108/0/0); exact-head PR CI passed. Same-account approval is PR comment `5085013285`; expected-head merge succeeded and the remote branch is deleted. No product, security-boundary, release, manifest, package, or framework behavior changes.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-spawn-modal-fix · coordinator: dev-coordinator-spanwer-modal-bug
- taught us: nothing beyond the harvested lesson itself — in repeated mergeability-only handbacks, treat a named base as an ancestry minimum, verify live refs, honor holds, and keep replies evidence-backed and non-duplicative.

## PR #45 (round 5) — Desktop spawn readiness handoff, modal close, and quiet terminal open (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `6f35e9e` at final exact head `9c4e995` after four mergeability-only RETURNs. All four gates PASS. The Desktop now waits for `running && tmux.session` under existing workspace/operation/composite-identity guards before post-spawn terminal handoff, closes the successful modal, degrades safely on timeout, and wraps the entire quiet auto-open promise chain so transport/mount failures warn rather than block or become unhandled rejections; interactive opens retain their prior behavior. Original detached scratch gates passed root 557/558 with one expected node-pty ABI skip, Desktop 352/352, check, validate, all-eight-bundle strict OKF with zero warnings, pack:check, and diff-check. Every subsequent delta was coordinator/stewardship knowledge plus merge commits; owner reran root tests and strict OKF. Final head contained live main `7cb1673` (ahead 9, behind 0), GitHub reported CLEAN/MERGEABLE, and root CI plus all three installer checks passed. Same-account approval is PR comment `5084986482`; expected-head merge succeeded, remote branch was deleted, and local cleanup remains with the owner's worktree. Post-merge scaffold-only child probe `oats-expert-pr45-probe` verified AGENTS/CLAUDE, soul/work links, memory scaffolding, real skill directories, child relation metadata, `launched:false`, and clean retirement. Not yet released.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-spawn-modal-fix · coordinator: none
- taught us: the code change itself was review-clean; the four RETURNs exposed a high-cadence coordination hazard where delayed handback mail and concurrent stewardship repeatedly supersede named bases. Exact-SHA ancestry checks plus an explicit stop/wait barrier are necessary, but the maintainer should merge immediately once a settled head is behind zero.

## PR #45 (round 4) — Desktop spawn readiness handoff, modal close, and quiet terminal open (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at handed-back/API head `0b6853a23a2ffdf8788f99d9b1910364a07e42a6` for mergeability only. This head correctly contained required main `9f703c1`; its post-review delta was only the known coordinator lesson plus PR #45 stewardship/merge commits, leaving the focused Desktop code/harvest untouched. Prior product/correctness/security/full-gate results stand; owner reported the committed-tree gate green and exact-head CI restarted. During final handback, main advanced to `9ad504f` with PR #44 stewardship only, leaving the branch behind by one with merge-base `9f703c1`. Same-account verdict is PR comment `5084963883`; owner was told to stop and wait for the post-round-4 stewardship SHA.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-spawn-modal-fix · coordinator: none
- taught us: fast concurrent maintainer stewardship can move main even after an ancestry-verified final handback; the next retry must merge one explicitly named post-verdict base after all concurrent stewardship known at that moment.

## PR #45 (round 3) — Desktop spawn readiness handoff, modal close, and quiet terminal open (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at handed-back/API head `f614be5a969f5d15b302dbd98b8803e0c45d40fb` for mergeability only. The delta since round 2 is the expected trivial merge of `627ffaa`: only round-1 oats-expert stewardship knowledge arrived, while the reviewed Desktop code/harvest remained untouched. Prior product/correctness/security results stand; owner-reported root gates and exact-head root CI passed while installer jobs reran. Mergeability still failed because the handback again merged the superseded base rather than explicitly named successor `b5c9f3d`; live compare was behind by one with merge-base `627ffaa`. Same-account verdict is PR comment `5084952256`; the owner was told to stop and wait for the post-round-3 stewardship SHA before merging again.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-spawn-modal-fix · coordinator: none
- taught us: serial stewardship handbacks need an explicit acknowledgment barrier—when the owner repeatedly consumes the earlier base message before the follow-up commit arrives, tell them to wait for the post-verdict SHA rather than immediately merging the now-superseded base.

## PR #45 (round 2) — Desktop spawn readiness handoff, modal close, and quiet terminal open (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at handed-back/API head `40938b81c133bde0af38a9c7e45ab0c4e1142fe8` for mergeability only. The delta since round 1 is the expected trivial merge of `8191ea0`: only the dev-coordinator spawn-modal race lesson/index/log arrived, while the reviewed Desktop code and Desktop harvest delta remained untouched. Round-1 product, correctness, and security PASS results stand; the owner reran the full root gate successfully, and exact-head CI began rerunning. Mergeability still fails because the branch omitted round-1 stewardship commit `627ffaa`, despite the explicit base follow-up; GitHub compare remained behind by one with merge-base `8191ea0`. Same-account verdict is PR comment `5084945671`; owner was replied to in the existing aweb thread.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-spawn-modal-fix · coordinator: none
- taught us: a handback can acknowledge an earlier main SHA while missing the explicitly communicated stewardship-bearing successor; verify ancestry against live `origin/main`, not the handback phrase “current main.”

## PR #45 (round 1) — Desktop spawn readiness handoff, modal close, and quiet terminal open (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `67d865c9223950e917289b655b22657825c2dce2` for mergeability only. Product direction, correctness, and security PASS: the Desktop-owned flow waits for `running && tmux.session` under existing operation/workspace/composite-identity guards, closes the modal on readiness, degrades on timeout, and contains the entire quiet async open chain without changing interactive behavior or trust/execution boundaries. Fresh detached scratch gates passed `npm test` 557/558 with the expected node-pty ABI skip, Desktop 352/352, check, validate, all-eight-bundle strict OKF with zero warnings (Desktop 107 concepts), pack:check, and diff-check; exact-head PR CI and all three installer jobs passed. Mergeability alone fails because current main advanced to `8191ea0` after handback while the branch merge-base remains `55fbc98` (GitHub compare behind by one). Same-account verdict is PR comment `5084936254`; owner was mailed to merge current main and return a settled exact head.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-spawn-modal-fix · coordinator: none
- taught us: nothing new beyond the established settled-handback rule — a semantically related coordinator harvest landed after feature handback, so even an otherwise clean green branch must merge the current main before final review.

## PR #44 (round 7) — Desktop split/sidebar UI buttons, active-tab split seeding, split-aligned tab strip (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `479e8b5` at final exact head `f9e9ebb` after six mergeability-only RETURNs and one superseded same-head approval. All four gates PASS. The Desktop split/sidebar follow-up adds clickable context-gated split/sidebar controls, active-tab split seeding DOM coverage, a dedicated full-width pane-tab row with real tab elements grouped per split pane, and directly relevant Desktop soul lessons. Full scratch gates passed at the reviewed feature head: root `npm test` 565 pass / 1 expected node-pty ABI skip, Desktop 360/360, check, check:pi, validate, all-eight-bundle strict OKF with zero warnings, pack:check, smoke:tarball, and diff-check. Final live head contained current main `e8a4bd8`, kept the same 12-file scope, resolved the Desktop knowledge log newest-first with no conflict markers, and exact-head PR CI plus all three installer checks were green. Same-account approval is PR comment `5085035759`; expected-head merge succeeded. `gh pr merge --delete-branch` reported a detached-worktree branch-detection error after the merge, so the remote feature branch was deleted manually. Post-merge scaffold-only child probe `oats-expert-pr44-probe` verified AGENTS/CLAUDE, soul/work links, memory scaffolding, real skills, child relation metadata, `launched:false`, and clean retirement. Not yet released.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui · coordinator: none
- taught us: nothing new beyond the PR #46 harvested handback-race lesson and this PR's own split UI lessons; the terminal merge confirmed why maintainers must use expected-head guards and live GitHub refs instead of handback prose in high-cadence PR queues.

## PR #44 (round 6) — Desktop split/sidebar UI buttons, active-tab split seeding, split-aligned tab strip (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at live exact head `ad9ff4f9e94b94298b8c6768012bc13f693381d3` for mergeability/current-main only. The branch contained the required `f9898d3` base and exact-head checks were green, but before merge current main advanced to PR #46 (`83ce16f`), leaving `2551f1d` and `83ce16f` outside PR #44 and GitHub reporting CONFLICTING. Prior product/correctness/security/full-gate results stand. No product/code correction is requested; this is another current-main conflict from a concurrent Desktop knowledge harvest merge. Same-account GitHub blocked formal request-changes, so the return was posted as PR comment `5085017894` and mailed in-thread to the owner. The owner must wait for the post-round-6 stewardship SHA, then merge/rebase that exact current main and resolve any Desktop knowledge log conflict newest-first.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui · coordinator: none
- taught us: nothing new beyond the already-recorded expected-head guard and crossed-mail/current-main rules.

## PR #44 (round 5) — Desktop split/sidebar UI buttons, active-tab split seeding, split-aligned tab strip (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at live exact head `abdbd2805fa263908d3fe0acd4f0215440b5726b` for mergeability/current-main only. The handback mail named stale head `ff64caa`, but live PR #44 had force-updated to `abdbd28`; its merge-base with current main was `8aa8a93`, leaving PR #45 merge stewardship `abd60d1` and main merge `8d5dba5` outside the branch. Prior product/correctness/security/full-gate results stand, and the described Desktop knowledge-log union resolution is the right shape. No product/code correction is requested. Same-account GitHub blocked formal request-changes, so the return was posted as PR comment `5085000620` and mailed in-thread to the owner with another acknowledgment barrier: wait for the post-round-5 stewardship SHA, then merge/rebase that exact current main before handback.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui · coordinator: none
- taught us: nothing new beyond the crossed-mail/current-main loop already captured; use live PR API/fetch state over handback prose whenever mails and force-pushes cross.

## PR #44 (round 4) — Desktop split/sidebar UI buttons, active-tab split seeding, split-aligned tab strip (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at live exact head `07d714c2bc464b6b32e78e1def09100ea05a78be` for mergeability only, superseding the same-head approval comment. The live PR had correctly merged required main `7cb1673`, scope stayed the reviewed 12 Desktop/Desktop-soul files, exact-head CI plus all three installer jobs were green, and GitHub reported MERGEABLE. The maintainer recorded an approval comment, but the expected-head merge failed immediately because PR #45 landed on main as `6f35e9e` and made PR #44 CONFLICTING. `git merge-tree origin/main origin/pr/44` showed the conflict in `agents/oats-desktop-engineer/soul/knowledge/log.md`; `packages/desktop/renderer/shell.mjs` auto-merged. No product/code correction is requested; prior product/correctness/security/full-gate results stand. Same-account GitHub blocked formal request-changes, so the return was posted as PR comment `5084988353` and mailed in-thread to the owner. The owner must merge/rebase the post-return current main successor and resolve the Desktop knowledge log by keeping both deliveries newest-first.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui · coordinator: none
- taught us: even after a green exact-head approval, a concurrent merge can invalidate the expected-head merge before the command runs; keep the expected-head guard, and treat the failed merge as a new mergeability RETURN rather than forcing the maintainer-side conflict resolution.

## PR #44 (round 3) — Desktop split/sidebar UI buttons, active-tab split seeding, split-aligned tab strip (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `4b91095ab09ce5196b78c1076d1fa7a7d78f1521` for mergeability/current-main only. The handback merged previous base `b5c9f3d` but missed current main `9ad504f`, including the explicitly mailed PR #44 round-2 stewardship successor. Prior product/correctness/security results stand and no product/code correction is requested; the missing commits are stewardship-only (`9f703c1` PR #45 return stewardship and `9ad504f` PR #44 round-2 return stewardship). Same-account GitHub blocked formal request-changes, so the return was posted as PR comment `5084966685` and mailed in-thread to the owner with an acknowledgment barrier: wait for the post-round-3 stewardship SHA, then merge/rebase that exact current main before handback.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui · coordinator: none
- taught us: repeated mergeability-only returns need the same explicit acknowledgment barrier used for PR #45 when a handback consumes the earlier base but misses the post-return stewardship successor.

## PR #44 (round 2) — Desktop split/sidebar UI buttons, active-tab split seeding, split-aligned tab strip (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `defa48d2e36a14e099678375957420e5c3a54d8a` for mergeability/current-main only. The round-1 scope blocker is fixed: the merge range contains only `packages/desktop/**` UI changes plus directly relevant oats-desktop-engineer knowledge harvests. Product direction, correctness, and security PASS. Scratch gates passed after dependency install and copied installed capabilities: root `npm test` 565 pass / 1 expected node-pty ABI skip, `packages/desktop` test 360 pass, `check`, `check:pi`, `validate`, all-eight-bundle strict OKF with zero warnings (changed Desktop bundle 108/0/0), `pack:check`, `smoke:tarball`, and diff-check. Exact-head PR CI plus all three installer checks were green. Mergeability FAIL only because current GitHub `main` advanced to `b5c9f3d` while PR #44's merge-base remained `8191ea0`; `origin/main` is not an ancestor. Same-account GitHub blocked formal request-changes, so the return was posted as PR comment `5084954174` and mailed in-thread to the owner.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui · coordinator: none
- taught us: nothing new beyond the existing settled-handback rule — stewardship commits on main can make an otherwise green exact-head PR stale and require a fast current-main refresh before merge.

## PR #44 (round 1) — Desktop split/sidebar UI buttons, active-tab split seeding, split-aligned tab strip (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `883688203fa33ab8e6174ef96e715e6d322bf99b` for product/diff-shape gate failure. The Desktop UI direction itself was not rejected, but the PR merge range contradicted its `packages/desktop`-only description by carrying unrelated dev-coordinator soul instruction/skill/lesson changes, ux-designer log changes, and oats-expert architecture/decision/roadmap/stewardship changes including new package/distribution and strict-curriculum decisions. Correctness/security gates were not run under fail-fast policy. Same-account GitHub blocked a formal request-changes review, so the RETURN was posted as PR comment `5084929494` and mailed to the owner. The branch must be rebuilt so PR #44 contains only the split/sidebar/tab-strip UI work plus directly relevant Desktop harvests, or the unrelated base commits must land through their own proper maintainer path first; then the owner should rerun gates/CI and hand back a new exact head SHA.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-ui · coordinator: none
- taught us: branch-scope review must include the whole merge range, not just the PR body or intended code area; local/direct stewardship commits that are not on GitHub main can accidentally ride along in a feature PR and must be split before review continues.

## PR #42 — oats-desktop-engineer quick-open deferred-intent harvest (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `09605c7` at exact head `028a984`. All four gates PASS. The knowledge-only PR preserves retiring instance `oats-desktop-engineer-quick-open`'s post-merge harvest commit (`97654ce`, cherry-picked as `028a984`) in the canonical Desktop soul: the pending-intent data-currency lesson and Quick Open → Spawn preselect handoff decision now state that module-level deferred preselects must die with the mounted Spawn consumer on unmount. Final scratch gates passed after root + Desktop dependency install and copied installed capabilities: targeted oats-desktop-engineer strict OKF `106 concept(s), 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)`, aggregate `validate:okf` all 8 bundles with zero warnings, `npm test` `554/555` with the expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `validate`, `pack:check`, and diff-check. The current code/test surface already carries the reviewed unmount clear and regression test. Exact-head PR CI was green; same-account approval was recorded as a comment; expected-head merge succeeded and the remote branch was deleted.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-quick-open · coordinator: dev-coordinator-keybindings
- taught us: nothing new — the existing post-merge harvest review rules applied cleanly: compare the source harvest commit, inspect per-bundle strict OKF output, and semantically read the linked concepts rather than trusting the cherry-pick summary alone.

## PR #41 — Desktop split panes + hideable sidebar (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `c055614` at exact head `2ff4792`. All four gates PASS. Desktop terminal tabs can now form bounded side-by-side or stacked split layouts while preserving tab identity, fit/resize behavior, pane-level selection, adjacent close fallback, and single-selection accessibility; the sidebar can be hidden with a persisted, editable shortcut. Non-mac `Ctrl+B` remains tmux-owned because `sidebar.toggle` is excluded from the terminal allowlist. Final scratch gates passed: `npm test` 554/555 with one expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `validate`, strict OKF for all 8 bundles (changed Desktop soul 106 concepts, 0 errors/warnings), `pack:check`, and diff-check; exact-head PR CI and all three installer checks passed. Same-account approval was recorded as a comment. Expected-head merge succeeded; the remote branch was deleted manually because `/private/tmp/integrate-split-panels` holds the local branch.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-split-panels · coordinator: dev-coordinator-split-panel
- taught us: nothing new beyond the PR's harvested Desktop lessons — shifted punctuation defaults need real event-key tests, terminal action allowlists require resolved-control-byte review, split model state must match renderer-visible slots, and active-member close fallback must be chosen before removal.

## PR #40 — Desktop Quick Open for souls + terminal focus on user jumps (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `3da7ce8` at exact head `9d00985`. All four gates PASS. The Desktop now has a shared overlay picker, `Mod+P` Quick Open over souls that hands off to Spawn's consumed-once preselect flow, and explicit `activateTab(id, { focusContent })` terminal-focus intent so palette/sidebar/post-spawn user jumps focus the xterm input while workspace restoration and close fallbacks do not steal focus. Final scratch gates passed: `npm test` 535 tests (534 pass, one expected node-pty ABI skip), `check`, `check:pi`, `validate`, `validate:okf` (8 bundles, 0 warnings), `pack:check`, `smoke:tarball`, renderer `node --check`, and diff-check; exact-head PR CI plus all three installer verify jobs passed. Same-account approval was recorded as a comment; `gh pr merge` merged but could not determine a branch from detached scratch for branch cleanup, so the remote feature branch was deleted manually.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-quick-open · coordinator: none
- taught us: nothing new beyond the PR's own harvested Desktop lessons: the shared palette scorer must use an out-of-band no-match sentinel, consumed-once intents must gate on current data generation, and terminal focus must remain opt-in by user intent.

## PR #39 — v0.18.6 manifest bump rescue (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as squash commit `9fc7c0e`. Release run `30198186842` completed build/test, all three Desktop installer build+smoke legs, both npm publishes, provenance, checksums, and GitHub Release v0.18.6 before the known org policy blocked Actions from creating the bump PR. The workflow-created branch contained exactly the five expected root/pi/Desktop manifest and lockfile changes (0.18.5→0.18.6); manual PR #39 restored the protected-main flow and deleted the branch.
- owner: oats-expert-pr38 · coordinator: dev-coordinator-parallel
- taught us: nothing new—the detached-HEAD push remains fixed and the documented org-policy rescue is still required after successful publication.

## PR #38 (round 3) — spawn-time agent relations across kernel, CLI, and Desktop (2026-07-26)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `dfa0ac0` at exact head `4bbfe8d` after two RETURNs. All four gates PASS. The feature adds explicit child/sibling/parent/unrelated spawn relations, ambiguity-safe root-qualified anchors, attached child-of-owner semantics, retirement splice repair, composite instance identity across Desktop, cluster-first Active/sidebar surfaces, and the relation-aware spawn modal; it also preserves PR #35 keyboard shortcuts and PR #36 knowledge with identity-correct interaction fixes. The human-declined journal/lease subsystem findings remain documented accepted limitations. Final scratch gate passed 507/508 with one expected environment skip after one transient server-start miss passed alone and on full rerun; check/check:pi/validate/all-eight-bundle strict OKF/pack/smoke/diff-check passed; exact-head PR CI and all three installer checks passed. Same-account approval was recorded as a comment; expected-head merge succeeded and the remote feature branch was deleted. Post-merge scaffold-only child-relation probe `oats-expert-pr38-probe` verified the full generated layout, real skill directories, `parentInstance`/`relation`/`relativeTo`, no launch, and clean retirement.
- owner: feature/agent-relations developers · coordinator: dev-coordinator-parallel
- taught us: broad feature merges must re-test interactions with recently landed surfaces, not only resolve conflicts—the keybinding merge exposed three composite-identity/modal ownership paths that were fixed before handback. Final delivery also confirmed the settled-handback rule when a maintainer harvest landed between rounds.

## PR #38 (round 2) — spawn-time agent relations across kernel, CLI, and Desktop (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `df2e575` for mergeability only. Round-1 knowledge fixes PASS: cli-dev strict OKF 34/0/0, Desktop strict OKF 99/0/0, final relation matrix/accepted limitations are coherent, and stale maintainer recipe, pending clarifier, removed-roster, and future-tense projection claims are corrected. PR #35/#36 integration and the three identity/keybinding interaction fixes PASS targeted review and 54/54 tests. Full scratch gate passes 507/508 with one expected environment skip, check/check:pi/validate/all-eight-bundle strict OKF/pack/smoke/diff-check; exact-head PR CI and all three installer checks are green. Product direction, correctness, and security PASS. Mergeability FAIL only because the maintainer's already-running round-1 harvester completed after handback and advanced main to `d60ee05`; that semantic PR-review lesson is not in `df2e575`, so current main is no longer an ancestor.
- owner: feature/agent-relations developers · coordinator: dev-coordinator-parallel
- taught us: this is the existing settled-handback rule in action — a reviewer-driven harvest launched before handback can finish after it and invalidate otherwise exact, green ancestry. Do not launch another harvest before the next handback.

## PR #38 (round 1) — spawn-time agent relations across kernel, CLI, and Desktop (2026-07-26)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `e3f7401`. Product direction PASS: explicit sparse live lineage is the right layer, `RELATIONS_MIN=0.18.6` matches the required release, and the human-declined journal/lease subsystem findings are accepted non-blocking limitations. Executable correctness and security PASS: scratch `npm test` 449/450 with one expected environment skip, check/check:pi/validate/pack/smoke and diff-check passed. Knowledge correctness FAIL: cli-dev strict OKF reports three unreachable new concepts, and changed concepts retain stale transitional claims about the maintainer spawn recipe, a resolved “pending clarifier,” removed Instances-roster language, and already-landed forwarding. Mergeability FAIL: GitHub reports CONFLICTING/DIRTY; merge-tree conflicts are the Desktop knowledge log, shell, hierarchy, and spawn view, and the branch lacks current PR #35/#36 main.
- owner: feature/agent-relations developers · coordinator: dev-coordinator-parallel
- taught us: aggregate `validate:okf` can exit zero and print a green final line while individual strict bundles still report producer warnings; inspect per-bundle output, and keep semantic knowledge review separate from validator exit status. The accepted architecture is recorded in [Spawn relations use sparse live lineage, not a transaction journal](/decisions/spawn-relations-live-lineage.md).

## PR #36 (round 3) — oats-desktop-engineer post-PR35 keybindings harvests (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `032c7a3` at exact head `1e9980f` after two RETURNs. All four gates PASS. The knowledge-only PR preserves both keybindings developers' stranded post-PR35 harvests in the oats-desktop-engineer soul: dispatch-ineligible view-action semantics, crossed-mail coordination, PR35 follow-up queues, modal focus restoration, and the DEFAULT_KEYMAP/defaultChord split/terminal allowlist delivery follow-ups. Final scratch gates passed: targeted oats-desktop-engineer strict OKF 92/0/0, repo `validate:okf` all 8 bundles, `npm test` 433/434 with the expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `check:pi`, `validate`, `pack:check`, clean diff-check, exact-head PR CI green, and `origin/main` ancestor verified. Approval was recorded as a PR comment because GitHub blocks same-account approvals. Expected-head merge succeeded; `gh pr merge --delete-branch` merged but failed local branch deletion because `/private/tmp/harvest-wiring` holds `harvest/keybindings-wiring`, so the remote branch was deleted manually.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer keybindings-wiring + keybindings-core harvests · coordinator: dev-coordinator-keybindings
- taught us: the semantic-parent cherry-pick lesson was promoted before merge; nothing further beyond verifying remote heads and ancestry after crossed mail.

## PR #36 (round 2) — oats-desktop-engineer post-PR35 keybindings harvests (2026-07-25)
- verdict: RETURNED at actual GitHub head `617241c` for mergeability only. The fixed branch now carries both developers' post-merge harvests: `44bf38a` matches the missing dispatch-ineligible view-action harvest `5543ac5`, `b29dfb0` matches the wiring follow-up harvest `4da43b2`, and the core-dev modal-focus/delivery-follow-up concepts are present and semantically coherent. Product direction, correctness, and security PASS; scope remains 13 files under `agents/oats-desktop-engineer/soul/knowledge/` with no executable/config surface. Fresh scratch gates passed: targeted oats-desktop-engineer strict OKF 92/0/0, repo `validate:okf` all 8 bundles, `npm test` 433/434 with the expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `check:pi`, `validate`, `pack:check`, clean diff-check, and green PR CI. Mergeability FAIL: the handback mail named stale local head `835fa98` while the actual PR head is `617241c`, and that branch still does not contain current main (`77a2d08` after the round-1 memory-harvest lesson; merge-base remains `efc62ca`). Author/coordinator must merge latest main, preserve the four harvest commits, rerun gates/CI, and hand back the new exact head.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer keybindings-wiring + keybindings-core harvests · coordinator: dev-coordinator-keybindings
- taught us: nothing new beyond the crossed-mail lesson — trust the PR remote/head and `merge-base`, not handback prose, when mail and branch updates cross.

## PR #36 (round 1) — oats-desktop-engineer post-PR35 keybindings harvest (2026-07-25)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `d26a356` for one knowledge-correctness fix. Product direction, security, and mechanical mergeability passed: scope is 5 files under `agents/oats-desktop-engineer/soul/knowledge/`, no executable/config surface, `origin/main` was an ancestor, `git diff --check` was clean, PR CI was green, and GitHub reported MERGEABLE. Local scratch gates passed after root + Desktop dependency install and copying installed capabilities: targeted oats-desktop-engineer strict OKF 90/0/0, repo `validate:okf` all 8 bundles, `npm test` 433/434 with the expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `check:pi`, `validate`, and `pack:check`. Blocker: the branch cherry-picked final harvest commit `4da43b2` as `d26a356` but omitted its original parent harvest `5543ac5` (`memory-harvest: merge view-action dispatch guard lesson`), so the new follow-up queue links the final dispatch-ineligible view-actions model while PR head still has stale `first-class-view-defaults-window-dispatch-surface.md` guidance telling readers to guard registered `run()` handlers. Author must include `5543ac5` or equivalent concept/index/log updates, rerun gates, merge latest main, and hand back an exact head.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer keybindings-wiring harvest · coordinator: dev-coordinator-keybindings
- taught us: cherry-picking the terminal harvest commit is not enough when that commit's parent contains unmerged semantic knowledge fixes; compare the source branch state, not only the cherry-picked diff, before declaring a post-merge harvest preserved.

## PR #35 (round 3) — Desktop user-editable keyboard shortcuts for all panel actions (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `7f1e5a7` at exact head `039458f` after two RETURNs. All four gates PASS. The feature adds Desktop's central keybinding engine, user-editable shortcuts editor, action-id terminal allowlist interception before PTY writes, rebindable stage/tab/sidebar/terminal typography/view-local actions, full roster/spawn/hierarchy keyboard operation, live chord labels/tooltips, and renderer syntax coverage. Final deltas after round 2 made view-local actions editor-visible but window-dispatch-ineligible via never-activated `view:*` contexts. Fresh final local gates passed: `npm test` 433/434 with the expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `check:pi`, `validate`, `validate:okf`, and `pack:check`; exact-head PR CI plus macOS arm64/x64 and Linux x64 installer verify checks passed. Approval was recorded as a PR comment because GitHub blocks same-account approvals. Expected-head merge succeeded; `gh pr merge --delete-branch` failed only to delete the local branch held by `/private/tmp/integrate-keybindings`, so the remote `feature/keybindings` branch was deleted manually.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer keybindings branches · coordinator: dev-coordinator-keybindings
- taught us: first-class engine defaults can accidentally widen global dispatch for view-local actions; the clean pattern is to register view actions in editor-visible but never-activated view contexts and dispatch them only through the focused view surface.

## PR #35 (round 2) — Desktop user-editable keyboard shortcuts for all panel actions (2026-07-25)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `b5651b6` for mergeability only. The round-1 knowledge finding was fixed in `bc95b5c`: the transitional stub concept now marks `matchesChord` as stub-only, states the final engine owns the `defaultPrevented` and editable-field guards, and cross-links the superseding lessons. The additional code deltas (`afd2114` surface-guarded view-local action dispatch and `0649fa0` deletion of the dormant legacy `resolveViewKey` chord fallback) passed maintainer delta review. Fresh local gates passed: `npm test` 433/434 with the expected node-pty ABI skip, `check`, `check:pi`, `validate`, `validate:okf`, and `pack:check`; GitHub PR CI plus all three installer checks were green. Mergeability failed because `origin/main` was no longer an ancestor after the maintainer stewardship commit from round 1 (`merge-base b10dd13`, main at least `54b2f2c`), so the author must merge the latest main and hand back a settled exact head.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer keybindings branches · coordinator: dev-coordinator-keybindings
- taught us: stewardship commits after a RETURN intentionally advance main; final handback must merge the latest stewardship-bearing main, not just the code base that existed when the return was issued.

## PR #35 (round 1) — Desktop user-editable keyboard shortcuts for all panel actions (2026-07-25)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `811cb06` for one knowledge-correctness fix. Product direction, code correctness, security, and mechanical mergeability passed: scratch `npm test` passed 434/435 with the expected node-pty ABI skip after installing root + Desktop deps; `npm run check`, `check:pi`, `validate`, `pack:check`, and `validate:okf` passed; main was an ancestor; GitHub PR CI and all three installer verify checks were green. Blocker: `agents/oats-desktop-engineer/soul/knowledge/decisions/keybindings-stub-coordinator-contract.md` still claimed the real engine does not skip `defaultPrevented` and the shell must guard, and listed non-existent `matchesChord`, contradicting the final engine and later lessons.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer keybindings branches · coordinator: dev-coordinator-keybindings
- taught us: concurrent branch-union harvests can leave historical transitional concepts contradicting the final converged design; final PR handback must include a targeted knowledge consistency read, not only strict OKF conformance.

## PR #34 — v0.18.5 manifest bump rescue (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as squash commit `8f5af90`. Release run `30160666617`
  completed build/test, all three Desktop installer build+smoke legs, both npm
  publishes, provenance, checksums, and GitHub Release v0.18.5 before the known
  org policy blocked Actions from creating the bump PR. The workflow-created
  branch contained exactly the five expected root/pi/Desktop manifest and
  lockfile changes (0.18.4→0.18.5); manual PR #34 restored the protected-main
  flow and deleted the branch.
- owner: oats-expert-release-desktop-ux · coordinator: dev-coordinator-parallel-2
- taught us: nothing new — the documented org-policy rescue path remains
  necessary, while the fully qualified detached-HEAD branch push still works.

## PR #33 (round 3) — Desktop Shift+Enter send leak and terminal copy selection (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `595159e` at exact head `d75fa3a` after two
  RETURNs. All four gates PASS. The feature suppresses every xterm event in a
  Shift+Enter chord while writing one `\n` on keydown, and enables xterm's
  modifier-forced local selection for terminal copy (Option on macOS, Shift on
  non-macOS). It preserves PR #32's Instances-stage removal and carries accurate
  Desktop knowledge. Fresh final affected gate passed 30/30 merged-head tests,
  check/check:pi, strict OKF for all 8 bundles, and diff-check; the earlier full
  scratch gate passed 382 tests plus validate/pack/smoke; human live verification
  and all four exact-head CI/installer checks passed. Approval was recorded as a
  PR comment (shared account), expected-head merge succeeded, and the remote
  branch was deleted.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-session-copy-newline · coordinator:
  dev-coordinator-parallel-2
- taught us: xterm custom key handlers span keydown, keypress, and keyup, so a
  replacement chord must suppress all phases and emit once. Also, a handback can
  be truthfully fresh yet immediately superseded by the maintainer's own
  previously launched harvest; settle reviewer-driven commits before the final
  handoff. The next patch release must combine PR #32 and PR #33 without
  modifying immutable v0.18.4 artifacts.

## PR #33 (round 2) — Desktop Shift+Enter send leak and terminal copy selection (2026-07-25)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `0a9c6df` for one knowledge-correctness fix
  plus mergeability. The branch correctly merged main twice, preserved PR #32's
  Instances-stage removal and this PR's `terminalOptions(...)` construction,
  unioned the append-only soul log, and passed 30/30 targeted merged-head tests,
  Desktop strict OKF (76 concepts, 0 errors/warnings), diff-check, the owner's
  repeated full gates, and all four exact-head CI/installer checks. Correctness
  FAIL: the updated Shift+Enter lesson still names removed classifier
  `shiftEnterByte(ev)` instead of `shiftEnterAction(ev)`, and the product comment
  says Shift+drag works “everywhere” although shipped xterm uses Option on macOS
  and Shift only on non-macOS. Mergeability FAIL: reviewer-driven harvest
  `71b4aa1` completed after handback and advanced main, so current main is no
  longer an ancestor. Author must fix both claims, merge final current main,
  rerun the affected/full gate, and return a settled exact SHA.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-session-copy-newline · coordinator:
  dev-coordinator-parallel-2
- taught us: nothing new beyond the existing settled-handback lesson — the
  owner rechecked correctly, but the maintainer's own previously launched
  harvest landed during the handoff window. Round 2 deliberately launches no
  further harvest before the next handback.

## PR #33 (round 1) — Desktop Shift+Enter send leak and terminal copy selection (2026-07-25)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `605607a` for mergeability only. Product
  direction, correctness, and security PASS. Fresh scratch gate passed 382
  tests (381 pass, one intentional node-pty ABI skip), check/check:pi,
  validate/strict OKF/pack/smoke; human live verification passed; all four
  exact-head PR/installer checks are green. Mergeability FAIL: the branch is
  based on `d3b0e69` and does not contain current main `41272b6`, missing seven
  PR #32/main commits. Both sides changed `packages/desktop/renderer/shell.mjs`;
  GitHub currently auto-merges it cleanly, but the author must merge current
  main, preserve both changes, rerun the full gate, and return a settled green
  exact head.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-session-copy-newline · coordinator:
  dev-coordinator-parallel-2
- taught us: xterm's custom key callback spans keydown, keypress, and keyup; a
  modifier override that suppresses only keydown can still leak a default
  keypress byte. Behavioral regressions must drive the whole physical chord,
  not just the first DOM event. The pending next patch should combine this fix
  with PR #32's already-landed correction; immutable v0.18.4 stays untouched.

## PR #32 — remove the out-of-scope Desktop Instances stage (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `97f66c9` at exact head `69641c9` after one
  RETURN. Direction and security passed throughout. Round 1 returned because a
  delayed-spawn fallback still directed users to the deleted “Instances view”
  and the branch lacked current main. Round 2 points and regression-pins that
  path to the permanent sidebar roster, corrects stale stage-era comments, and
  contains main `d3b0e69`. Fresh final gate passed: root 376 tests + one
  intentional skip, check/check:pi/validate/strict OKF/pack/smoke, Desktop
  183/183, human live workspace verification, independent reviewer APPROVE,
  and all four exact-head GitHub CI/installer checks. Approval was recorded as
  a PR comment (shared account); expected-head merge succeeded. The remote
  branch was deleted manually because the owner's worktree holds it locally.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-roster-scope-rollback · coordinator:
  dev-coordinator-parallel-2
- taught us: a surface-removal inventory must cover user-visible fallback and
  recovery copy, not only imports, nav entries, modules, and CSS. A broad
  “operation failed truthfully” assertion can stay green while directing users
  to a destination the same PR deleted. See [Surface removal inventories must
  include user-facing recovery copy](/lessons/surface-removal-inventory-user-guidance.md).
  Corrective source is on main but needs a new patch release; v0.18.4 artifacts
  remain immutable.

## PR #31 — v0.18.4 manifest bump rescue (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as squash commit `fda7498`. The tag-driven v0.18.4 release
  completed build/test, all three Desktop installer build+smoke legs, both npm
  publishes, provenance, and the GitHub Release before the known org policy
  blocked Actions from creating the bump PR. The workflow-created branch
  `release-bump/v0.18.4` contained exactly the five expected root/pi/Desktop
  manifest and lockfile changes (0.18.3→0.18.4); manual PR #31 restored the
  protected-main bump flow and deleted the branch.

## PR #29 (round 3) — Desktop UX fixes final merge (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `b7203eb` at exact head `9736852`. All four
  gates PASS. The final branch contains current main `5aa596f`, preserves both
  PR #29 UX and PR #30 corrected-installer knowledge histories, is API-clean/
  mergeable, and passes Desktop OKF strict (74/0/0). Exact-head GitHub checks
  all SUCCESS: Node 22 test/validate/pack/smoke plus macOS arm64, macOS x64,
  and Ubuntu x64 installer legs. Round-2 scratch correctness gate already
  passed 379 tests + one intentional node-pty ABI skip, check/validate/pack.
  Approval recorded as a PR comment (shared GitHub account); merged with the
  expected-head guard; remote feature branch deleted.
- owner: dev-coordinator-parallel-2 · coordinator: dev-coordinator-parallel-2
- taught us: the final workspace-sort contract needs identity at both storage
  and transition boundaries — key preferences by canonical workspace ID and
  resync on explicit switch plus silent server adoption. Parallel same-soul
  harvests require an append-only log union immediately before final handoff.
  Release version is intentionally selected at the next coordinated release,
  not bumped in this feature PR.

## PR #29 (round 2) — Desktop UX fixes re-review (2026-07-25)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `23e3c71` for mergeability only. The round-1
  correctness ask is fully fixed by `9c7c5c6`: sort persistence is a
  canonical-workspace-ID map, resynced on explicit switch and silent adoption,
  with safe legacy/corrupt fallbacks and behavioral A→B→A coverage. Fresh full
  gate PASS: 379 tests pass + one intentional node-pty ABI skip; check/validate/
  pack pass; Desktop soul OKF strict 71/0/0. Direction/security remain PASS.
  Mergeability FAIL: PR #30 advanced `origin/main` after the branch's earlier
  main merge; GitHub reports DIRTY/CONFLICTING and `git merge-tree` reproduces
  the conflict in `agents/oats-desktop-engineer/soul/knowledge/log.md`. Author
  must merge latest main, union the append-only log, and return green exact-head
  PR + installer checks.
- owner: dev-coordinator-parallel-2 · coordinator: dev-coordinator-parallel-2
- taught us: same-soul feature and harvest PRs conflict even when product code
  is independent; final handoff must follow all parallel knowledge harvests and
  bind to current main immediately before merge.

## PR #30 — post-v0.18.3 corrected-installer knowledge harvest (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `935d142` at exact head `a220a306`. Product
  direction, correctness, security, and mergeability PASS. Scope is 13 files,
  all under cli-dev or oats-desktop-engineer soul knowledge/skills; no product,
  release, manifest, or framework behavior changes. Strict repo OKF PASS across
  all 8 bundles (0 errors, 0 warnings). Independent merged-state reviewer
  `reviewer-a220a30` on required `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.8:high` APPROVED
  with no blockers/security findings; required CI green. Maintainer approval was
  recorded as a PR comment because the shared GitHub account cannot approve its
  own PR.
- owner: cli-dev + oats-desktop-engineer memory harvests · coordinator:
  dev-coordinator-1
- taught us: a knowledge-only integration still benefits from an exact-head
  merged-state review because security guidance can alter operator behavior.
  Here the aweb mismatch skill stayed safe: diagnostics are read-only, it bans
  ad hoc identity repair, and sensitive actions still require independent
  confirmation. The sole reviewer nit (updating a concept timestamp alongside
  an Update log entry) was harmless.

## PR #29 (round 1) — Desktop UX fixes: spawn/chat/roster/workspace tabs (2026-07-25)
- verdict: RETURNED at exact head `fb1f1bc`. Direction and security PASS;
  clean scratch full gate PASS (359 tests pass, one intentional node-pty ABI
  skip; check/validate/pack; Desktop soul OKF strict 71/0/0). Correctness FAIL:
  the PR promises per-workspace roster sort persistence, but
  `views/instances.mjs` reads/writes one global `oats.desktop.rosterSort` key,
  so A's choice leaks into B; asked for canonical-workspace scoping and an
  A→B→A regression. Mergeability FAIL: branch was 10 commits behind current
  main (`e1ea91c` vs merge-base `f453b3e`), including v0.18.3 Desktop signing/
  packaging changes; author must merge main and return a green combined head.
- owner: dev-coordinator-parallel-2 · coordinator: dev-coordinator-parallel-2
- taught us: persistence described as “per workspace” needs a cross-workspace
  switching regression; a one-workspace localStorage test can pass while the
  preference silently leaks across workspace identity. Release version remains
  a release-time choice, not a feature-PR bump.

## PR #27 — publish valid ad-hoc-signed macOS installers (2026-07-25)

  the v0.18.2 macOS installer defect (arm64 shipped an incomplete
  linker-generated ad-hoc signature → Gatekeeper "damaged"; x64 unsigned).
  Drove release **v0.18.3** (tag on `921f44a`).
- owner: (feature/macos-correct-installers) · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- gates: all four pass. `electron-builder.config.cjs` `identity: null → "-"`
  (complete ad-hoc bundle signature); afterPack documented to run BEFORE signing
  so the spawn-helper chmod lands inside the seal. Strict
  `codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2` gated fail-closed both as an
  external workflow step AND unconditionally in `dist:smoke` on darwin
  (platform-only guard, no OATS_SMOKE_* can skip it), before artifact upload;
  the two workflow verifier run-blocks are enforced byte-identical by
  `test/release-workflow.test.mjs`. `CSC_FOR_PULL_REQUEST:"true"` on
  build-installers only (PR legs need it to actually sign; release.yml is
  tag-push so omits it) — safe, no signing secrets, deterministic ad-hoc.
  Release-notes existence gate added (fail fast pre-publish). New suites pass:
  codesign-verify 15/15, release-workflow 17/17. CI evidence (runs 30156699308
  + 30156539653, head 77b7ae4): arm64/x64 Signature=adhoc, Sealed Resources v2
  rules=13 files=179, node-pty packaged-ABI (x64 under Rosetta). Manifests stayed
  0.18.2 (tag-derived); no v0.18.2 asset mutation; Linux unaffected. Approve
  recorded as PR comment (same gh account). Remote branch deleted manually (dev
  worktree held the local branch).
- taught us: the release bump-PR step now fails ONLY on the org-policy cause,
  not the refspec — PR #25's `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>` fix worked (push logged
  `[new branch] HEAD -> release-bump/v0.18.3`), then `gh pr create` failed with
  `GraphQL: Resource not accessible by integration (createPullRequest)` (org
  policy blocks Actions-created PRs). Rescue: publish was already complete
  (never retag) — created + squash-merged the bump PR manually (**PR #28**,
  main `9a6eae8`, manifests → 0.18.3). The release run shows conclusion=failure
  purely because of this final step; npm + GitHub Release succeeded. Until an
  org admin relaxes the Actions-PR policy, every tag-driven release needs this
  one manual bump-PR step.

## PR #26 — cli-dev soul: promote detached-HEAD release refspec lesson (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `0061eb5` — knowledge-only, exact head
  `9f43317`. Lands the harvested lesson from cli-dev-desktop-dist-2's v0.18.2 /
  PR #25 work into the canonical cli-dev soul (its delivery branch was not
  merged directly, so a follow-up PR carried the soul update).
- owner: cli-dev-desktop-dist-2 (retired) · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- gates: OKF-correctness gate for a knowledge-only PR — strict validator PASS
  (19 concepts, 0 err/0 warn); one Lesson added
  (`lessons/exact-tag-detached-head-refspec.md`), indexed with description
  matching frontmatter, log newest-first; both referenced links resolve
  (release-workflow-static-tests.md, playbooks/release-tag-driven-ci.md); no
  unrelated changes (3 files, all under cli-dev soul knowledge). Approve
  recorded as PR comment (same-account GitHub block).
- taught us: nothing new — clean knowledge harvest; confirms the promote-lesson
  follow-up PR flow when a completed developer's delivery branch never merged.

---
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `8d7d2ee` — all four gates PASS at exact head
  `e52826518`. Post-release one-line automation repair: the version-bump branch
  push in the publish job runs from a DETACHED HEAD (publish checks out
  `ref: github.sha`), where `git push origin "HEAD:${BRANCH}"` cannot infer
  `refs/heads/` and fails ("not a full refname") — the only red step of the
  v0.18.2 release, after all publication succeeded. Fix qualifies the
  destination to `HEAD:refs/heads/${BRANCH}` (+ explanatory comment). Direction:
  minimal, correct layer, no new contract surface. Correctness: guard VERIFIED —
  14/14 static release-workflow tests pass on the fix, and the new guard FAILS
  (not ok 7) when the ambiguous `HEAD:${BRANCH}` form is reintroduced. Security:
  push-destination refspec only — no trust-boundary/hook/order change. No
  retag/republish; v0.18.2 stays terminally complete.
- owner: cli-dev · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- taught us: nothing new on the codebase — this is the landed form of the fix
  the PR #22 delivery-log entry and repo-state open thread had already proposed
  (`HEAD:refs/heads/${BRANCH}`). The refined root cause is detached-HEAD ref
  inference (not only same-name-tag ambiguity); fully-qualifying the ref cures
  both. Approval recorded as a PR comment (same-account block), then merged.

## PR #22 — Linux executableName release-blocker fix + re-cut v0.18.2 (2026-07-25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `7cc3b5b` — all four gates PASS at head
  `1a95e7e`. Fix VERIFIED on REAL green installer builds (build-installers
  run 30153115337, all 3 legs): ubuntu x64 AppImage(124MB)+DEB(96MB)
  built+smoke-verified, macos-14 arm64 DMG+ZIP, macos-14 x64 DMG+ZIP under
  Rosetta. `executableName: "oats-desktop"` (linux-scoped) + DEB
  `maintainer`/`homepage`. Complete 0.18.1→0.18.2 sweep; compat band
  unchanged. release.yml: fail-fast:false, macos-13 sunset runner dropped
  (x64 cross-builds on macos-14 under Rosetta).
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer-desktop-dist · handoff: oats-maintainer (verified);
  coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- release: tag `v0.18.2` on `7cc3b5b` → run 30153347086 PUBLISHED
  `@awebai/oats@0.18.2` + `@awebai/oats-pi@0.18.2` (latest) + GitHub
  Release v0.18.2 with all 7 assets (mac arm64/x64 DMG+ZIP, linux
  AppImage+DEB, SHA256SUMS + provenance). desktopApi contract verified on the
  PUBLISHED artifact: `oats version --json` == `{schemaVersion:1,...,version:"0.18.2",desktopApi:1}`.
  Manifest bump-PR (#24) manually rescued (CI step failed on an ambiguous
  `git push HEAD:release-bump/v0.18.2` refspec — tag v0.18.2 exists so the
  partial ref couldn't resolve; publish was already done). Orphan `v0.18.1`
  tag deleted post-green (operator OK).
- taught us: the tag-driven release's Linux/mac installer build can't be
  rehearsed pre-merge (tag must be on main), so a packaging-config defect
  (scoped-name AppImage executableName) survives the full local gate and
  fails only in a real release with nothing published — see
  [lesson](/lessons/release-ci-linux-build-unrehearsable-pre-merge.md). This
  PR also SHIPPED the structural gap-closer: a verify-only `build-installers.yml`
  (PR + workflow_dispatch, contents:read, fail-fast:false, own concurrency)
  that builds every installer leg on PRs without any publish surface. Also:
  the CI bump-PR push uses a partial refname (`HEAD:${BRANCH}`) that becomes
  ambiguous once the same-name tag exists — a real release.yml bug worth
  fixing to `HEAD:refs/heads/${BRANCH}` (proposed to human).

## PR #21 — OATS Desktop v0.18.x standalone Electron app + legacy-panel succession (2026-07-24/25)
- verdict: MERGED as merge commit `0961175` — all four gates PASS at head
  `975a44a`. Direction: matches decisions/desktop-public-release-contract in
  substance (installer matrix, Desktop CLI API v1, no-CLI observation mode,
  split ownership, dormant Diff/Jira removal, RETIRED_CAPABILITIES doctor
  diagnostics). Correctness: 333 pass/1 env-skip; check/validate/okf/pack/
  tarball-smoke green. Security: loopback+DNS-rebind+CSRF, terminal cap 20 in
  the owning main process, wx 0o600 task files, argv allowlist (execFile, no
  shell), realpath TOCTOU-hardened file-root guard, no kernel imports —
  strengthened, not weakened. Mergeability: CLEAN, 5 conflicts author-resolved,
  okf lock sha256-45c0… == oats.okf 1.4.0.
- owner: oats-desktop-engineer + cli-dev (multi-dev) · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- release fallout: the initial `v0.18.1` cut (0.18.0 already npm-published via
  #20 with no Desktop/desktopApi; idempotent skip-guard would skip a re-tag)
  FAILED at the Linux desktop-build — nothing published. Superseded by the
  operator-chosen `v0.18.2` re-cut (PR #22).
- taught us: independently verify the version-cut rationale against npm +
  GitHub Releases state, not just the coordinator's narrative — 0.18.0 was
  npm-only (no Release/installers), which is exactly why a fresh version was
  needed. A green PR gate + sound-looking release.yml is NOT proof the release
  publishes (see PR #22).

## PR #19 (round 3) — desktop succession + explicit spawn lineage (2026-07-24)
- verdict: MERGED as `9b39ee7` — all four gates PASS at exact final head
  `daa0b98`. Direction: desktop owns its backend and immediately retires
  oats.web, `oats pane`, and `lib/control-pane`; the adjacent-core bridge is
  explicitly release-blocking distribution debt, not a merge blocker.
  Correctness/security: fresh expanded gate, scaffold probe, ownership and
  lock checks passed; round-2 traversal was closed by generated-name syntax
  validation plus realpath immediate-child containment, with regressions for
  spawn-before-scaffold, retire-before-delete, canonical-soul survival, normal
  lookup, and an escaping symlink. Mergeability: exact-head GitHub CI green,
  current main ancestor, conflict-free merge-tree, and clean diff-check.
- owner: dev-coordinator-1 · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- taught us: a final handback is not final while reviewer nits are still being
  merged; bind approval to the actual PR SHA and exact-head check run. The
  release remains blocked until desktop installers and installed-CLI mutation
  boundaries are operational.

## PR #19 (round 2) — expanded desktop succession + explicit spawn lineage (2026-07-24)
- verdict: RETURNED — direction PASS against the amended immediate-cutover
  decision (direct-core bridge explicitly release-blocking debt); exact-head
  `047acbb` GitHub CI and scratch full gate green (234
  tests, one intentional ABI skip, all validation/pack/smoke), scaffold-only
  probe passed, ownership/removal/retirement diagnostics and lock integrity
  verified. Security/correctness FAIL: new shared `findInstanceHome(root, name)`
  accepts path traversal as an instance name. Reproduced `oats spawn dev
  --parent ../../dev/soul` accepting malformed lineage; the same helper powers
  retirement, and `oats retire ../../dev/soul` recursively deleted the canonical
  soul in an isolated probe. Author must reject separators/dot traversal,
  enforce immediate-child containment, and regress both spawn and destructive
  retire. Mergeability also has two `git diff --check` extra-blank-line errors.
- owner: dev-coordinator-1 · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- taught us: filesystem existence under `join(instancesDir, untrustedName)` is
  not identity validation; every instance-home lookup, especially destructive
  lifecycle callers, needs name validation plus resolved containment.

## PR #19 (round 1) — OATS Desktop transitional Electron app and oats.web bridge (2026-07-24)
- verdict: RETURNED — direction PASS against the accepted desktop succession
  decision; correctness/mergeability FAIL because required PR CI is red. The
  root test script now includes `packages/**/*.test.mjs`, but
  `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml` installs only root dependencies: 8
  desktop suites fail in a clean runner on missing `jsdom`/`marked` (187/196
  pass). Exact-head scratch gate after root + desktop installs reached 238/239;
  the remaining macOS node-pty prebuild-helper permission failure cleared with
  the README-required Electron rebuild, and the targeted real-wheel test then
  passed. Check/check:pi/validate/OKF/pack/smoke all passed. Owner asked to make
  CI install desktop dependencies, merge current main, and return a green
  exact-head gate.
- owner: dev-coordinator-1 · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- taught us: once a root test glob includes a private nested package that is
  not an npm workspace, root `npm ci` is not a complete CI environment; the
  workflow must install that package's lockfile too.

## PR #17 — oats-web 0.8.1 typing visibility + latency (echo snap+burst, off-thread roster snapshot) (2026-07-22)
- verdict: MERGED — all four gates green. Direction: right layer; the
  server-never-collects child-process snapshot is the correct fix for the
  single-threaded event loop; human-confirmed-on-dev-port process endorsed.
  Correctness: scratch-worktree gate 65/65 tests + check/validate/pack:check;
  OKF strict pass on the webpanel-dev bundle (two new lessons promoted).
  Security: /api/keys --debug logs metadata+byte-count only; keySendError
  shapes exec failures (exit status/signal only — e.message embeds hex-encoded
  keystrokes in argv) with a leak regression test. Approval recorded as PR
  comment (same-account block); merge-commit merge; remote branch deleted via
  `git push origin --delete` (webpanel-dev-1 worktree held it — owner notified).
- owner: webpanel-dev-1 · coordinator: none
- taught us: branch CI is red from a PRE-EXISTING environment gap — the
  /api/agents test expects the capability-defined 'reviewer' agent, but CI's
  bare checkout lacks .agents/capabilities/installed/; also failed on the
  PR #14 branch. Needs a CI fix or test guard (open thread). Also: on a
  single-threaded server, audit periodic exec*Sync handlers before tuning
  the hot path — tail latency, not median, was the felt lag.

## PR #14 (round 3) — oats-web 0.8.0 spawn-from-panel (2026-07-22)
- verdict: MERGED — all four gates green; approval again a PR comment
  (same-account block — applies to --request-changes too). Round-3 merge
  commit ea1f5b1 resolved the post-#16 four-file conflict exactly as asked:
  0.8.0 + >=0.16.0 floor kept, main's makeRegistryCache findInstance
  preserved untouched (zero main-side deletions) alongside the branch's
  agentsData()/spawnAgent(), soul index/log unions. Scratch-worktree gate:
  63/63 tests (OATSWEB_KEYROUTE + #16 registry-cache/attach tests), check,
  validate, pack:check. Merge-commit merge (clean history); remote branch
  deleted via `git push origin --delete` (author worktree held it — owner
  notified).
- owner: webpanel-dev-spawn-from-panel · coordinator: none
- taught us: two consecutive pure-mergeability RETURNs on one PR confirms
  the staleness lesson (promoted to lessons/) — authors should re-check
  `mergeable` at handback; the author's round-2 resolution (verified
  adjacency by parse + live probe) is the standard we want. Release pending:
  marketplace oats.web 0.5.0 vs repo 0.8.0.

## PR #14 (round 2) — oats-web 0.8.0 spawn-from-panel re-review (2026-07-22)
- verdict: RETURNED again — gates 1–3 still PASS (no new branch commits
  besides the requested main merge 237d628, which resolved the PR #13
  conflicts exactly as asked); gate 4 FAIL: main moved under the branch —
  PR #16 (oats-web 0.7.2 fast attach) merged after 237d628, so the branch is
  CONFLICTING again in four files: oats.json (0.7.2/>=0.14.0 vs 0.8.0/
  >=0.16.0), bin/oats-web.mjs (registry-cache findInstance vs the branch's
  agentsData/spawnAgent additions — adjacent, both must survive), and
  webpanel-dev soul index.md + log.md (union). Author asked to merge main
  again, keep main's makeRegistryCache findInstance plus their additions,
  re-run the full gate, and re-check `mergeable` right before handback.
- owner: webpanel-dev-spawn-from-panel · coordinator: none
- taught us: with several PRs landing on one capability the same day, a
  returned PR can go stale between fix and re-review — advise authors to
  re-merge main immediately before handback, and consider sequencing
  same-capability PRs. `gh pr review --request-changes` hits the same
  same-account block as approve; the structured RETURN lives as a PR
  comment.

## PR #16 — oats-web 0.7.2 fast session attach: registry cache, single tmux round-trip, three-rung paint (2026-07-22)
- verdict: MERGED — all four gates green; approval again a PR comment
  (same-account block). Measured root cause was `findInstance()` rebuilding
  the whole control-pane model per `/api/session` request; fixed with a pure
  injectable 2.5s-TTL registry cache (`makeRegistryCache`), `paneSize` +
  `historySize` merged into one tmux `display-message` round-trip
  (`paneInfo`), and a three-rung client attach (cached-frame paint → 120-line
  tail → gen-guarded 2000-line backfill; `lines` in the render signature so
  the tail never suppresses the deep paint). Reviewer nits addressed in
  1555f2b via extracted marked blocks (OATSWEB_REGCACHE, OATSWEB_ATTACH) with
  unit tests. Full gate green in scratch worktree: 61/61, check, validate,
  pack:check. Remote branch deleted with `git push origin --delete` (author
  worktree held it locally — owner notified).
- owner: webpanel-dev-1 · coordinator: none
- taught us: round-trip count, not payload size, dominated attach latency —
  merging tmux queries and caching a rarely-changing roster beat any render
  optimization; the marked-block extraction pattern now covers server-side
  factories too (new Function over the extracted block), not just browser
  code. Release still pending: marketplace oats.web 0.5.0 vs repo 0.7.2.

## PR #14 — oats-web 0.8.0 spawn-from-panel: /api/agents + /api/spawn (2026-07-22)
- verdict: RETURNED — gates 1–3 (direction, correctness, security) PASS; gate 4
  (mergeability) FAIL: branch forked before PR #13 and conflicts with main in
  capabilities/oats-web/oats.json (version/description) and webpanel-dev's soul
  index.md. Full gate verified green in a scratch merge with main (60/60,
  check, validate, pack:check). agentsRoot allowlist (selector into server
  workspace roots) is a sound pattern; compat-floor regression test
  (core.* API → min kernel version map) is a keeper. Author asked to merge
  main, resolve the two conflicts, re-run the gate, and re-request.
- owner: webpanel-dev-spawn-from-panel · coordinator: none
- taught us: the /api/agents test needs the deployment's installed
  capabilities (.agents/capabilities/installed with oats-review) — a bare
  scratch worktree fails it environmentally; copy installed/ in (or run from
  the deployment root). Also: scratch worktrees need `npm install` before
  `npm run validate` (ajv devDep).

## PR #13 — oats-web 0.7.1 'cannot type' fix: logical pane key routing (2026-07-22)
- verdict: MERGED — all four gates green; approval again a PR comment
  (same-account block). Root-caused 0.7.0 regression: keydown bound to the
  term element and gated on DOM focus silently dropped keys after any
  header/toggle click. Fix routes via a window-level listener to the
  logically focused pane, excluding real editable controls; Cmd-B toggles
  sidebar, Ctrl-B always reaches the session (tmux prefix). New
  OATSWEB_KEYROUTE marked block + node regression test (59/59); no change to
  /api/keys or the loopback POST guard; webpanel-dev OKF bundle --strict
  clean, new lesson concept recorded.
- owner: webpanel-dev-1 · coordinator: none
- taught us: DOM focus is too fragile a routing key for pane UIs — logical
  focus state plus an editable-control exclusion is the robust model; the
  marked-block extraction pattern (from PR #8) generalized cleanly to key
  routing. Remote branch deletion needed `git push origin --delete` because
  the author's worktree held the local branch.

## PR #12 — oats-web 0.7.0 panel refinements (2026-07-22)
- verdict: MERGED — all four gates green; approval again a PR comment
  (same-account block). Terminal-unified input (composer + `/api/send`
  removed), adaptBg near-neutral truecolor-bg fold with regression tests,
  compact `.phead` header, collapsible sidebar + split panes with per-pane
  state/gen guards; webpanel-dev OKF bundle validates --strict.
- owner: webpanel-dev-1 · coordinator: none
- taught us: removing an endpoint is a security win worth naming in review
  (smaller surface); per-pane generation counters are the clean pattern for
  multi-pane stale-response/key-leak guards. Release still pending — 0.7.0
  (and 0.6.0) unpublished until the next tag.

## PR #10 — webpanel-dev soul doc nits from PR #8 review (2026-07-22)
- verdict: MERGED — docs-only, both corrected claims verified against
  oats-web implementation (`capture-pane -p -e` without -J; server-side
  `\r\n?` → `\n` into load-buffer/paste-buffer -p); bundle passes OKF
  --strict. Approval again recorded as PR comment (same-account block).
- owner: webpanel-dev-1 · coordinator: none
- taught us: nothing new — the return-as-follow-up flow from PR #8 closed
  cleanly in one docs-only PR.

## PR #8 — oats.web 0.6.0 terminal-faithful session view (2026-07-22)
- verdict: MERGED — all four gates green; approval recorded as a PR comment
  (GitHub blocks same-account `gh pr review --approve`).
- owner: webpanel-dev-terminal-fidelity · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- taught us: zero-dep held under real pressure — the hand-rolled SGR
  renderer with a DOM-free marker block (`OATSWEB_RENDERER_BEGIN/END`)
  extracted for node tests is a reusable pattern for testing browser-embedded
  logic without a bundler. New POST Host/Origin loopback guard hardens the
  panel's 127.0.0.1 posture against DNS rebinding. Two doc nits returned
  as follow-ups (stale `-J` reference, inverted paste-normalization claim
  in webpanel-dev's knowledge). Release needed to publish 0.6.0.

## PR #4 — session-error surfacing (2026-07-22)
- verdict: CLOSED — approved on quality, discarded by operator instruction
  before merge; branches deleted.
- owner: dev-coordinator-1 (multi-dev: tui-dev-1, webpanel-dev-1)
- taught us: first full multi-dev run; failure modes recorded in
  lessons/multi-dev-run-failure-modes.md and fixed in v0.17.0.
