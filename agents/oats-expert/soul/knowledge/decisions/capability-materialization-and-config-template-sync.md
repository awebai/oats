**Status: accepted by the founder 2026-07-29.** This decision supersedes the
installed-package-root and `configs:` portions of [Distribution packages,
config profiles, and consented host requirements](/decisions/distribution-packages-config-profiles-and-requirements.md).
It preserves package-level source/dependency/integrity/update transactions,
capability-level activation and trust, scoped config precedence, and explicit
host/runtime consent.

# Decision

## Package is transport; capability is the installed entity

An OATS distribution package is the source, dependency, integrity, review, and
atomic update unit. Acquisition stages a package in a temporary transaction
directory, validates the whole selected payload, materializes its declared
capabilities, writes the exact lock, and discards staging. A package root is not
the persistent user-facing installation.

A capability is the versioned installed and runtime-composed entity. Every
package must export at least one capability. A package may export several;
each remains independently targetable, activatable, configurable, excludable,
and trusted. Optional config templates are package source material, not
installed behavior.

The durable scope layout is:

```text
<scope>/
  oats-config.yaml                              # zero or one active config
  oats-lock.json                                # committed/restorable provenance
  .agents/
    capabilities/
      owned/<capability-id>/                    # authored source; normally committed
      installed/<capability-id>/                # generated installed artifact; ignored
    config-templates/
      adopted/<package-id>/<template-name>/
        oats-config.yaml                         # exact adopted base; commit-safe
        adoption.json                           # source/version/commit/path/hash metadata
```

There is no persistent `.agents/packages/installed/` in the final model. A
package checkout may exist only in transaction staging. Installed capability
artifacts carry generated package provenance (for example
`.oats-installation.json`) and the lock remains authoritative.

At every Git-backed scope, OATS ensures
`.agents/capabilities/.gitignore` ignores `installed/`; generated installed
capabilities must never enter commits. It must not ignore `owned/` or
`.agents/config-templates/adopted/`: authored capabilities and portable adopted
bases are intentionally reviewable/committable. Non-Git scopes use the same
layout without pretending Git owns their durability.

## Official catalog resolution is authoritative

For a capability ID mapped by the official catalog, fresh classic init and
explicit installation always acquire that catalog package and materialize its
capabilities under the revised-v2 contract. They never fall back implicitly to
the kernel's bundled legacy marketplace: that would recreate v1 state and grant
legacy acquisition trust. Catalog source unavailability fails clearly and
rolls the operation back. Offline operators use `--raw`, an explicit local
package/profile source, or an operator-supplied local catalog; OATS does not add
an ambient cache or compatibility bridge in this contract. Tests use hermetic
local catalogs and never depend on live network.

## Materialized capabilities are self-contained

For a new-format package, every capability entry names a dedicated capability
root. The installed artifact is the complete validated capability root,
including its `oats.json`, skills, injections, commands, hooks,
capability-defined agents, and any capability-local production closure.
Declared paths and symlinks must remain inside that capability root after
resolution. This tighter boundary makes each installed directory independently
hashable, inspectable, restorable, and trustable.

New packages use conventional roots such as
`capabilities/<capability-slug>/`; authoring tools do not emit `.` capability
roots. Compatibility readers may consume already-published packages whose
capability root is `.`, but migration must project only a self-contained
capability artifact and must fail rather than silently retain package-only
paths that cannot be represented safely.

Two packages at one scope may not install the same capability ID. Scope
precedence, `from: installed`, `from: owned`, and `from: path:<dir>` remain.
`from: installed` means the flat installed-capability store regardless of which
package supplied it.

## Lock package provenance and installed capability identity separately

The package lock remains `lockfileVersion: 2`, but its transitional
package-root shape is replaced in place by the final capability-materialization
shape. No v3 format or v2-to-v3 migration exists; the founder explicitly chose
simplicity because the transitional v2 contract has no external adoption that
must be preserved. The revised v2 records both levels:

```json
{
  "lockfileVersion": 2,
  "packages": {
    "example.engineering": {
      "source": "git:https://example.invalid/engineering.git@v3.0.0",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "commit": "0123456789abcdef",
      "path": "oats-package",
      "integrity": "sha256-…",
      "dependencies": []
    }
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "example.review": {
      "version": "2.1.0",
      "package": "example.engineering",
      "path": "capabilities/example-review",
      "integrity": "sha256-…",
      "trusted": false
    }
  }
}
```

Package integrity proves the exact distribution payload and dependency graph;
capability integrity proves the materialized installed bytes. Trust binds to
the capability integrity, never merely to official package identity. Updating
one package stages and verifies all its new exports, atomically replaces the
affected capability directories and lock entries, removes exports that no
longer exist only when config/dependents permit it, and invalidates trust for
changed executable surfaces.

Bare restore fetches the exact locked package source, verifies package
integrity, re-materializes missing capability artifacts, verifies their
individual integrity, and never advances source/version/commit.

## Config templates are optional and never applied by package installation

Package repositories name the source directory `config-templates/`, not
`configs/`. The package manifest names the resource `configTemplates`, for
example:

```json
{
  "package": "example.engineering",
  "capabilities": ["capabilities/example-review"],
  "configTemplates": {
    "default": {
      "path": "config-templates/default/oats-config.yaml",
      "default": true
    }
  }
}
```

New authoring emits only `configTemplates`. Readers temporarily accept the
published legacy `configs` spelling so immutable 0.19 package tags remain
consumable and migratable.

`oats install <package>` installs every exported capability but applies no
config template. It reports available templates as optional follow-ups. A
package with templates can therefore be used only for its capabilities.
Packages must export at least one capability; config-only and empty packages
are rejected in the new format.

## Exactly one active config and one adopted base per scope

A laptop, workspace root, or repository root has at most one active
`oats-config.yaml`. Different nested scopes may each have one and compose
through the existing outer-to-inner cascade. Package installation never creates
additional active configs at a scope.

First adoption is explicit:

```bash
oats init --package example.engineering --config default
```

It writes the one local `oats-config.yaml` and records the exact package template
as a visible, commit-safe base under `.agents/config-templates/adopted/`.
Templates must remain portable and contain no secret, credential, account,
machine path, or provider-local ID. The active config is immediately ordinary
local policy: hand edits and `oats use`/`oats type`/injection overrides remain
authoritative, and package updates never rewrite it. Product documentation,
README onboarding, CLI output, and authoring guidance must call these resources
**templates**, never installed policy or package-controlled config, and must
state plainly that adopters may change every copied setting as they wish.

One scope has at most one current adopted base template. Other installed
packages may advertise templates, but none becomes another active config. A
user may switch bases only through an explicit guided adoption/rebase.

## Synchronization is explicit, guided, and atomic

Updating a package makes a newer template available without touching local
policy:

```bash
oats update example.engineering
oats config diff
oats config sync
```

`oats config sync` performs a three-way comparison:

1. the recorded adopted base;
2. the current local `oats-config.yaml`; and
3. the selected template from the currently locked package.

Upstream-only changes may be offered for application; local-only changes remain
local; overlapping changes are conflicts requiring an explicit local/package/edit
choice. The command presents the complete plan before mutation, supports stable
JSON, refuses noninteractive ambiguity, writes atomically, updates the adopted
base only after success, and preserves a recoverable backup.

`oats config sync --reset` is the explicit exact-template replacement path. It
previews all lost local changes, requires strong confirmation (or an explicit
noninteractive acceptance flag), backs up the current config, and atomically
replaces both config and adopted-base metadata.

Switching to another package/template uses an explicit guided command such as:

```bash
oats config adopt other.package --config default
```

It rebases the one local config against the new base rather than installing a
second config.

## Migration and compatibility

The kernel continues to read valid v1 capability locks and their
`.agents/capabilities/installed/` artifacts so existing 0.18 deployments keep
working. Guided official migration converts v1 directly into the revised v2
lock and flat installed-capability artifacts. Revised v2 has no legacy-residue
container: if any row at one v1 scope must be retained, handled manually, or
held—including custom Git/path locks—the entire scope is blocked and remains
byte-identical usable v1. Official rows are not partially acquired, committed,
or removed. A scope with no convertible official work reports skipped plus its
retained IDs; dry-run and apply agree on readiness. Custom owned/path
capabilities remain unchanged and executable trust is never broadened.

The earlier transitional v2 package-root shape and
`.agents/packages/installed/` store receive no product migration path, dual
reader, or offline projection. Revised v2 requires top-level `packages` and
`capabilities`; package rows contain package provenance/dependencies only, while
capability path/version/integrity/trust live in the capability map. A nonempty
v2 lock missing that map is unsupported by itself; independently, any
package-row `capabilities`, `trustedCapabilities`, or optional `depsIntegrity`
field is transitional evidence. These are OR predicates—`depsIntegrity` is
never required because dependency-free old packages omit it. Final package rows
retain `path` and `dependencies`, so those are not discriminators. The reader
rejects centrally with typed `invalid-lock` and actionable
unsupported-transitional-v2 guidance before discovery or mutation. Raw lock
scope discovery—not config-chain discovery—must find lock-only scopes. An empty
packages-only lock may normalize as an empty revised-v2 lock because it carries
no state; empty v1 files remain visible pending format migration. Pre-adoption local
deployments may be recreated manually. Immutable package
manifests using `configs` or a `.` capability root remain read-compatible only
for acquiring their capabilities into the revised v2 shape.

A failed v1 conversion leaves the prior lock and store byte-identical. Doctor
reports the exact migration state and command.

# Consequences

- Users inspect installed behavior where Agent Skills conventions lead them:
  `.agents/capabilities/installed/`.
- Package provenance and atomic updates remain exact without treating config
  templates as installed policy.
- The one-config-per-scope rule stays obvious and compatible with config
  cascading.
- Guided template synchronization becomes safe because the original base is
  visible and portable.
- The change replaces the transitional v2 storage contract in place and requires
  official package revisions, v1 migration gates, fresh onboarding
  updates, and documentation changes before publication.
