Decided with the founder, 2026-07-14, as follow-ups to
[config shape v2](config-shape-agent-types-and-injections.md).

**Amended 2026-07-26:** sections 1, 2, and 4 remain accepted. Section 3's
ambient-skill coexistence behavior is superseded by [strict instance
curriculum](strict-instance-curriculum.md): instantiated souls receive only
the selected OATS skill/instruction curriculum while provider-native tools and
workflows remain available.

# 1. `injection:` → `injection-override:`

The per-entry key on capability entries, work modes, and the `oats:` kernel
block is renamed to `injection-override:` (values `<path>|none|default`
unchanged). Rationale: the old name read as "where the injection lives"; the
mechanism is an override of a packaged default, and the name should say so.

It is **rejected on `from: owned` and `from: path:` entries** with a pointed
error: the scope owns the package source, so the injection is edited directly
at `.agents/capabilities/owned/<id>/injects/<file>.md`. An override there
would be a second place to edit the same text — the drift trap this design
avoids. Scaffolding (`oats init` / `oats use`) emits the commented override
line only for `bundled`/`installed` entries; owned entries get a pointer
comment to their own `injects/` directory instead.

Rejected alternative: `oats install` auto-copying packaged injections into
`.agents/injections/capabilities/<id>.md` — it silently converts defaults
into pins, so package updates stop reaching deployments that never
consciously customized anything.

# 2. CLI verbs for the remaining mainstream config operations

Audit outcome: `init`/`use`/`install`/`trust`/`create --type` covered the
capabilities block, but two mainstream operations still required hand-edits.
Added:

- **`oats type add <name> [--description ...] [--dir ...]`** and
  **`oats type list`** — structural authorship of the `agent-types:` block
  (previously: `create --type` set soul membership but nothing declared the
  type, leaving a doctor warning whose fix was manual).
- **`oats inject eject <capability-id|work-mode|oats> [--dir ...]`** — copies
  the packaged default injection to the conventional
  `.agents/injections/...` path and sets `injection-override:` on the entry.
  Explicit intent; un-ejected deployments keep tracking packaged defaults
  through updates.
- **`oats use ... --settings key=value`** (repeatable) — binding settings
  without hand-edits.

Deliberately left as documented hand-edits (rare/expert surface):
`skill-overrides:`, the top-level `agents-md-injection:` map, `templates:`.

# 3. Ambient skills coexist (restriction flags dropped)

Previously spawn launched pi with `--no-skills --skill <home>/.agents/skills`
and Claude with an instance-local `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` + `--setting-sources
user`, making the OATS-composed set the *only* skill surface. The founder
judged this an adoption barrier: users migrating to OATS lose their existing
personal/workspace skills inside instances.

Now: pi keeps the explicit `--skill <home>/.agents/skills` but drops
`--no-skills`; Claude drops the config-dir override entirely (the instance's
`.claude/skills → ../.agents/skills` symlink surfaces the OATS set as project
skills). Harnesses discover ambient skills (user-level, packages, work tree)
*in addition to* the materialized set.

**Consciously traded away**: strict determinism of the instance skill
surface. The same soul on different machines may see different ambient
skills, and an ambient skill can shadow or duplicate an OATS-composed one
without failing spawn (the duplicate-skill error only arbitrates within the
OATS set). `instance.json` still records exactly what OATS composed; it no
longer describes everything the harness can see. Revisit if ambient
collisions cause real support burden — a per-scope `strict-skills: true`
config switch is the natural escape hatch.

# 4. Skill split

`skills/oats` was approaching the point where operating knowledge and
configuration craft crowd each other. Split: **oats** keeps
instance-operating content (layout, lifecycle, status/spawn/retire, memory,
canonical-vs-generated); **oats-config** takes configuration craft (scopes,
capabilities/layers, agent types, targeting, injections, acquisition/trust,
CLI verbs). Both ship in the kernel skill set.
