# Lesson

A spawn-relation policy change is unsafe if code and agent-facing recipes move
apart. When the "reviewers are your parent" policy became binding, stale
`oats-review` injection examples still showed relation-less attached reviewer
spawns, which auto-nested the reviewer under the developer, and maintainer
spawns with `--parent "$OATS_INSTANCE"`, which made maintainers children.

Future changes to spawn semantics or relation policy must migrate every live
recipe in the same change. Grep for `oats spawn` across injections, soul skills,
and docs, not only kernel docs. This extends the migration rule in
[spawn-lineage-explicit-only](/decisions/spawn-lineage-explicit-only.md).

# Retirement invariant

A relation that mutates another instance's lineage also needs retirement repair.
The parent relation re-points the anchor's `parentInstance` at the new instance;
without retire repair, an ephemeral reviewer retiring would leave the anchor
pointing at a missing instance and silently remove it from its displaced
coordinator's children.

`retireInstance` must splice a retiree out of the graph: any instance whose
`parentInstance` or `siblingInstance` names the retiree inherits the retiree's
complete surviving lineage, not just the retiree's same-typed edge. Link-less
retirees leave roots; dangling sibling links drop. Because spawn can create
cross-repo references through team-scope anchor resolution, repair must scan the
same scope where references can be created (`teamAgentRoots`, with guarded
local-root realpath handling when no `agents/` directory exists). The result
exposes `relinked[]` so callers can report the repaired instances. The current
lineage shape is summarized in
[spawn-relations-lineage-fields](/architecture/spawn-relations-lineage-fields.md).

General rule: whoever writes cross-instance metadata owns its repair on both
sides' lifecycle events, across the full scope where that reference can be
created.
