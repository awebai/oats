title: Marketplace over bundled — trust at acquisition, hoisted paths via lock source
description: Official capabilities are acquired from the kernel-shipped marketplace folder into a scope's installed/ store with trust written into the lock at acquisition, and hoisted-resource fallbacks stay keyed to marketplace lock provenance rather than capability id heuristics.

# The migration (v0.13.x)

"From bundled" is gone. `MARKETPLACE_DIR = <PKG_ROOT>/capabilities` is the
official marketplace; packages there are **not ambient** — `oats install <id>`
(or init) copies them into the scope's `.agents/capabilities/installed/`,
writes `oats-lock.json` with `source: marketplace:<id>@<version>` and computes
`integrity`. `from: bundled` in configs is rejected with a migration error.

# Trust at acquisition

Marketplace installs are **auto-trusted at acquisition** — the lock records
`trustedExecutables: true`. Rationale: they ship with the kernel you already
installed; a second `oats trust` would be ceremony without a security boundary.
Third-party git/path installs keep explicit `oats trust`. `capabilityTrust`
reads the lock; committed trust survives `oats install` restore **only when
integrity matches** (the repo is the trust boundary).

This trust rule is specific to the kernel marketplace copy route. When classic
init resolves an official fundamental layer through the package catalog, it is a
package acquisition instead: it may clone from the catalog URL and leave
executables untrusted until `oats trust`. See [catalog-first classic init costs](/lessons/catalog-first-classic-init-costs.md).

# The hoisted-path gotcha

Bundled packages (e.g. oats-aweb) reference framework-hoisted resources like
`node_modules/@awebai/pi/skills/...` that exist only in the kernel tree. A
copied install loses those paths, so the fallback must stay provenance-scoped:
only installed manifests tied to a marketplace lock source may reach the
kernel-shipped marketplace source. Do NOT widen this to id heuristics (`oats.*`
prefix) — the exemption must stay tied to the lock's provenance, or third-party
packages could escape their integrity boundary.

The fallback base is the declaring capability's canonical marketplace directory,
not raw `PKG_ROOT`. Relative paths in manifests are declaration-dir-relative; the
fallback is only a relocation to the shipped copy of the same declaration. See
[hoisted-resource fallback anchors](/lessons/hoisted-resource-fallbacks-anchor-at-declaring-dir.md)
for the `_marketplaceLock` version/source checks, capability-identity source
lookup, and symlink containment posture. The hoisted tree may sit outside the
copied install, but it is still walked against `PKG_ROOT` rather than exempted
from containment.

# Related trap

A marketplace package copied into a scope also loses **JavaScript relative
imports** into the kernel (v0.13.1 bug: oats-okf's hook imported
`../../lib/core.mjs`). Package scripts must not rely on their position inside
the kernel tree — resolve the kernel explicitly or keep such logic in the
kernel itself.
