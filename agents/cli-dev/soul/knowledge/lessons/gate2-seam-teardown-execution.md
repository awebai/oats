title: Gate-2 package seam teardown execution lessons
description: Executing the package-engine seam teardown showed that prewritten disposition inventories can make merge conflicts mechanical, repeated shared-suite re-merges should adopt upstream tests wholesale before re-applying a small greppable adaptation set, engine report enums need explicit mapping, and fixture/schema gaps surface during consumption.

# Gate-2 seam teardown execution

Executing the gate-2 teardown as a coordinator-authorized direct merge of the
package engine head confirmed and extended the
[package-engine seam teardown decision](/decisions/package-engine-seam-teardown.md):

- **Conflict hunks can be the teardown map.** Each `bin/oats.mjs` conflict hunk
  matched one prewritten inventory disposition: doctor merged engine diagnostics
  with the WS2 payload, restore kept engine `restorePackages` plus the
  reconcile envelope, trust kept the engine block wholesale, and help took the
  union. Writing the teardown plan before the merge made conflict resolution
  mechanical.
- **Both-sides-added tests should split by ownership.** When both sides added
  `test/packages.test.mjs`, the engine suite moved to
  `test/package-engine.test.mjs` after extracting both sides with
  `git show :2:`/`:3:`. Engine-superseded WS2 API tests were dropped because
  the engine suite covered them, while the merged CLI surface required updating
  two engine assertions: bare `install --json` now emits WS2's reconcile
  envelope, and `config` became a kernel command so its unknown-subcommand code
  changed.
- **Repeated shared-suite re-merges should adopt, then adapt.** When a sibling's
  evolving branch owns a copied shared suite, avoid three-way-merging large test
  bodies. Instead, replace the local adapted file with their current suite
  (`git show <their-head>:test/packages.test.mjs > test/package-engine.test.mjs`),
  re-apply only the local merged-CLI adaptations as a short list, and mark each
  with an `ADAPTED for the merged CLI` comment naming the governing decision.
  Run the suite after the replay; each failure is either a missing adaptation or
  a real behavioral conflict needing a decision, not an invitation to silently
  edit assertions. Keep the adaptation list short by relaying contract
  disagreements upstream early.
- **Map foreign report enums explicitly.** `restorePackages` can emit
  `status: "legacy"` rows with `package: null` for v1 locks. Those rows are
  informational and restored through the capability path; treating every
  non-`ok` status as a reconciliation failure made real deployments fail.
- **Fixture strictness ratchets during seam consumption.** The engine schema
  requires `compatibility` and rejects unknown keys, so fixtures needed
  `compatibility.oats`. Same-scope duplicate capability exports now throw during
  acquisition, so package fixtures needed distinct capability ids.
- **Consumption surfaced upstream engine gaps.** JSON `null` manifests crashed
  `loadPackageManifestAt` uncoded, relative dependency paths resolved against
  CWD instead of the depending package root, and empty v1 locks were not
  surfaced in `readPackageLocks`' legacy list; these were flagged upstream
  rather than fixed locally.

[legacy lock presence and invalid manifest handling](/lessons/frozen-package-engine-contract-alignment.md).
