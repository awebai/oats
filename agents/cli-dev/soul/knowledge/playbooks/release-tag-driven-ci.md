title: Release via tag-driven CI — never bump locally, probe the artifact
description: Releases are cut by pushing a vX.Y.Z tag on main which makes CI bump and publish packages; local version bumps break the workflow, retries must skip already-published artifacts, and verification means installing the published artifact.
tags: [release, ci, npm, github, verification, idempotency]

# The flow (.github/workflows/release.yml)

Push tag `vX.Y.Z` on a commit reachable from `main` → CI verifies the tag is
on main, runs `npm version X.Y.Z` in the root and `packages/pi`,
syntax-checks all shipped `.mjs`, runs tests/pack checks, publishes
`@awebai/oats` and `@awebai/oats-pi`, and pushes a
`release: vX.Y.Z [skip ci]` bump commit back to main. Requires the
`NPM_TOKEN` repo secret; `v*` tags are admin-restricted ("Bypassed rule
violations" on push is expected).

# Rules learned the hard way

1. **Never bump versions locally.** CI derives the version from the tag; if
   package.json already carries it, `npm version` fails with "Version not
   changed". package.json on main always shows the *previous* release when
   you tag.
2. **Make publication idempotent.** The documented retry path is "rerun from
   the same tag/assets", so each publication step must tolerate a partial
   previous run. Guard npm publication with `npm view "<pkg>@${V}" version`
   and skip when the version already exists; npm rejects republishing the same
   version, so an unguarded second `npm publish` blocks downstream packages and
   GitHub Release publication. Guard GitHub Release publication with
   `gh release view "$TAG"`: create the release when absent, otherwise upload
   assets with `gh release upload "$TAG" assets/* --clobber`.
3. **Probe the artifact, not the diff.** After CI goes green: fresh global
   install of the published version in a temp prefix, then exercise the new
   behavior end-to-end (e.g. for v0.12.0: cross-repo spawn from repo A homing
   in repo B, composed AGENTS.md correct, retire clean) and syntax-check the
   installed `.mjs`. Package smoke tests must cross the checkout boundary —
   a repo-local scaffold probe is not a substitute (pack tarballs, install in
   a clean external dir, run the installed CLI).
4. Release promptly after breaking config-shape changes: once live configs
   are migrated, the previously installed global kernel can no longer read
   them, and every `oats` command outside the checkout errors.

Fuller procedure: the `git-tag-release` skill in oats-expert's soul.
