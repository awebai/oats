title: Configurable package payload roots are selected explicitly per source kind
description: Git package roots are selected by a #<path> fragment, catalog roots by a catalog path field, local paths by their named directory, and locks keep the canonical path separate from source so updates and restores can preserve the right owner.

The package engine contract now treats a Git repository as a container that may
hold the package payload somewhere below the repository root. The selected
package root is explicit, not heuristic.

# Where the path lives

- **Git specs** carry the payload root as a `#<path>` fragment. Split the
  fragment off before `@ref` parsing; otherwise `repo@v1#dist` treats
  `v1#dist` as the ref. Only one fragment is valid.
- **Catalog entries** carry the payload root as data (`{ url, ref?, path? }`),
  not in the catalog id string. Allowing `#` on a catalog id would create two
  spellings for one selection and fight the catalog's ownership of package
  layout.
- **Local paths** take no fragment and always resolve to `.`. The named
  directory is the package root, whatever it is called; applying the Git default
  to local sources would break direct package development.
- The default is applied during resolution, not parse. Parsing records
  `packagePath: undefined` so a catalog entry can still supply one.

# Why `path` stays separate in the lock

The lock keeps the canonical payload path in a field separate from `source`.
`updatePackage` re-derives a spec from the locked `source`, and Git selections
and catalog selections need opposite round-trip behavior: a Git path is the
user's selection and must be re-appended as `#<path>` so it stays sticky, while a
catalog path belongs to the catalog and must be re-read so an update can adopt a
moved root.

The dependency-closure dedupe key is therefore `source#path`. Comparing only
`source` makes two contained roots in one repository look like the same package
resolved twice, silently dropping one instead of raising
`duplicate-package-identity`.

During `oats update`, that ownership difference becomes visible when an upstream
root is renamed:

- Git update rebuilds `<url>[@<ref>]#<locked path>` and fails `invalid-source` if
  the old path no longer exists. Re-acquiring with the new path is not the repair
  path because acquire refuses to advance a locked source as `integrity-drift`,
  and update still resolves the stale fragment; the operator must remove the
  package and then install the new `#<path>`.
- Catalog update rebuilds `<id>[@<selector>]`, re-reads the entry path, moves the
  lock to the new root, and reports `pathChanged` even if no bytes or version
  changed. The CLI prints the path-only movement as:

  ```text
  package path pkgs/x → packages/x (the selected package root MOVED in the source)
  ```

# Canonical path and lock advancement

Every spelling of the root (`""`, `"."`, `"./"`, `"./."`) normalizes to `"."`.
`validateLockEntry` requires the stored value to equal its own canonicalization;
a lock recording `"./sub"` is `invalid-lock`, not silently repaired on read.
Normalizing on read would make lock round trips untestable and would let two
byte-different locks claim the same pin.

Path changes are lock advancement. A plain `oats install` that resolves a
payload path different from the lock's `path` fails with `integrity-drift` before
integrity comparison, because two different roots can contain byte-identical
trees. The acquire-time path-mismatch diagnostic must branch on the **locked**
source kind because that is the source `oats update` re-resolves from: catalog
locks may recommend `oats update <pkg>` because the catalog entry owns `path`,
Git locks must not recommend update because the operator's `#<path>` fragment is
sticky across updates and must instead be repaired by remove-then-install with
the intended fragment, and local path locks always select `.` so this mismatch is
unreachable. See [diagnostic remedies are contracts](/lessons/diagnostic-remedies-are-contracts.md)
for the testing lesson.

Restore passes the locked path as an override that beats both the spec and the
catalog entry, so neither an upstream `git mv` nor a repointed catalog can change
what a bare restore installs. A bare restore is also pinned to the locked commit,
where the old root still exists, so an upstream move cannot break an existing
deployment.

# Test fixture facts

- `DEFAULT_PACKAGE_PATH` is `"oats-package"`; a bare Git source looks for
  `oats-package/oats-package.json`, and `#.` selects the repository root.
- `file://<dir>` is the network-free Git spelling. The `git:` shorthand demands
  `host/org/repo`, and a `path:` source forces `packagePath: "."` and rejects any
  `#<path>` fragment.
- On catalog update, `pathOverride` is undefined, so
  `pathOverride ?? entryPath ?? DEFAULT_PACKAGE_PATH` and
  `entryPath ?? pathOverride ?? DEFAULT_PACKAGE_PATH` are equivalent for that
  code path; a mutant swapping them can survive legitimately. Pair this fixture
  with the [CLI spawned-process hermeticity lesson](/lessons/cli-tests-scrub-oats-pi-env.md)
  when testing `test/cli-lifecycle.test.mjs` cases.

for how acquisition cuts the selected bytes out of the clone.
