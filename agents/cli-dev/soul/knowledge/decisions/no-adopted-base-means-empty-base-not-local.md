title: With no adopted base the merge base is empty, never the local file
description: Using the local config as the three-way base makes handcrafted lines look upstream-only, so a first adopt must use an empty base and surface overlap as conflicts.

# The bug in one line

```js
const baseText = adopted ? adopted.baseText : localText;   // WRONG
```

In a three-way merge, `base === local` means there are no local changes. Every
difference between base and template is therefore classified as upstream and
applied without conflict. A first `oats config adopt` over a handcrafted
`oats-config.yaml` replaced the whole file without consent or a loss preview; the
backup was the only recovery path.

The fixed rule is:

```js
const baseText = adopted ? adopted.baseText : "";
```

With an empty base, every existing local byte is genuine local work. If the
package template also wants that region, the merge reports a conflict, and
noninteractive runs already require an explicit `--accept <id>=local|package`.

# What the surrounding commands do

- `oats config diff` requires an adopted base and refuses with
  `E_NO_ADOPTED_BASE` when none exists, so it is not the preview for a first
  adopt.
- `oats config sync --reset` also presupposes an adopted base and refuses the
  same way. It is not the destructive path for a never-adopted scope.
- The first-adopt refusal must therefore carry the guided preview. The
  `E_SYNC_AMBIGUOUS` message enumerates conflict ids; before an adopted base
  exists, that is the only place the ids exist.
- Taking the package side wholesale stays explicit and recoverable: pass
  `oats config adopt <pkg> --accept <id>=package` for each region, and the command
  still writes the `.bak`.

# Why existing tests missed it

The existing adoption tests started from `oats init --package`, which writes the
template into an empty scope and records the base in the same run. The dangerous
state is a real config never adopted from any package — the normal upgrade path
when installing a package into a repository already configured by hand.
