# Prefer an integration-owned Linear GraphQL wrapper

For a contributed OATS Linear tasks integration, use Linear's official GraphQL
API through an integration-owned `oats linear` command wrapper. Node's built-in
`fetch` avoids an extra runtime dependency, while the wrapper can expose only
the task-safe operations agents need and return stable JSON.

The official `@linear/cli` is not suitable as the task layer's command surface:
its published interface only creates an issue or checks out a branch, so it
cannot read queues/issues, change workflow state, manage identity labels, or
post handoff comments. Third-party Linear CLIs offer broader but mutually
incompatible contracts. The official SDK is supported but large and unnecessary
for a small set of GraphQL operations.

Personal script authentication is a human-created Linear API key passed as the
raw `Authorization` header. Keep it in `LINEAR_API_KEY`, never tracker settings
in a checked-in `oats-config.yaml`. Because OATS `requires` describes commands,
not environment variables, use a non-blocking spawn-hook warning plus an
actionable `oats linear auth` failure to surface missing authentication.
