* **Creation**: [Lead every review handoff with the branch tip, and defer harvest during review](/lessons/review-handoffs-branch-tip-defer-harvest.md) records that review handoffs need the branch name plus current tip SHA, and that memory harvest should wait until review closes.
* **Creation**: skills/review-handoffs codifies branch-tip handoffs, fix proof, stale-SHA triage, and deferring `oats okf harvest` until review closure.
* **Creation**: [V1 lock migration is all-or-nothing per scope — no residue container in revised v2](/lessons/v1-lock-migration-no-residue.md) records that revised v2 lock migration has no residue container: unmappable entries hold the whole scope on byte-identical v1, and successful conversion writes a fresh v2 lock.
* **Creation**: [Capability-materialization doc terminology and the depsIntegrity trap](/lessons/capability-materialization-doc-terminology.md) records current OATS package/config documentation terminology and the runtime-closure integrity trap for materialized capabilities.

* **Creation**: [Compatibility aliases must appear in the public schema](/lessons/schema-migration-aliases-must-validate.md) records that migration aliases must validate against the public schema, not only the runtime loader.
* **Update**: skills/docs-maintenance — added a compatibility-schema check for legacy aliases accepted during migrations.
