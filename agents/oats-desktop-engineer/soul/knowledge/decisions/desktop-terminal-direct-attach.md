title: Desktop terminal is a direct tmux attach via node-pty
description: The desktop app's integrated terminal spawns node-pty running `tmux attach-session` against an isolated per-tab tmux viewer session that contains only a link-window to the exact source window and pipes bytes over IPC to xterm.js.

Per the desktop-app contract (binding): tmux stays the durable session host;
the Electron terminal is a **viewer client**. Main process preflights the exact
source session/window with [the exact-match target helper](/lessons/anchor-tmux-attach-targets.md),
creates a per-tab [isolated link-window viewer session](/lessons/desktop-terminal-link-window-viewer-isolation.md)
that contains only that exact source window, locks the viewer's prefix/root
window-navigation keys while preserving scrollback through a [provisioned locked
key table](/lessons/provision-locked-key-tables.md), then spawns
`pty.spawn("tmux", ["attach-session", "-t", "=<viewer>"])` per tab. Bytes stream
over IPC channels (`term:data:<id>` / `term:write` / `term:resize` /
`term:close`), and xterm.js + fit addon render in the isolated renderer.

Key semantics, verified live:

- `pty.resize(cols, rows)` on xterm resize resizes the attached client;
  tmux reflows.
- `pty.kill()` = tmux client detach from the viewer. Tab close, app quit, and
  signals may also clean up the isolated viewer session, but they must not kill
  the linked durable source window/session.
- pty `onExit` (e.g. source window killed externally) → renderer shows a
  "session ended" banner over the frozen scrollback; the viewer never falls
  through to a sibling durable-session window.
- Session and window components are validated before hitting tmux argv. Source
  preflight uses an exact `=session:=window` target, and pty attach uses an
  exact `=<viewer>` target so stale roster entries fail loudly instead of
  prefix-matching a different live window.
- xterm.js emits Enter as `\r` even when Shift is held, so the renderer maps
  Shift+Enter keydown to pi's raw `\n` / Ctrl+J newline alias and suppresses
  xterm's default carriage return; see [the Shift+Enter alias lesson](/lessons/shift-enter-newline-via-ctrl-j-alias.md).

Because each tab opens bounded OS resources, terminal open also needs
main-process reuse and hard-cap enforcement; renderer tab dedupe is only UX.
See [Bounded OS resources spawned per user action need a hard cap in the owning
process](/lessons/terminal-resource-cap-in-owning-process.md).

This is the opposite of the legacy web panel path (capture-pane polling +
send-keys through the backend HTTP API), which stays untouched as the
remote fallback.
