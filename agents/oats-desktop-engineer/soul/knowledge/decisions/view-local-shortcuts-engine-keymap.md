title: View-local shortcuts resolve chords through the engine keymap
description: View-scoped single-key shortcuts stay DOM-local but resolve through keybinding engine registrations so editor rebinds and registration-supplied defaults share one source of truth while editable-field safety remains view-owned.

# Decision

View-local shortcuts that are meant to be rebindable must resolve through the
keybinding engine instead of matching hard-coded `e.key` values in the view
handler. Hard-coded keys keep firing after an editor rebind and can shadow
another action's new binding.

# Pattern

Views declare actions in a local table such as `viewActions = [{ id,
defaultChord, run }]`, where `defaultChord` is the view's default. At mount they
register those actions with `registerAction({ defaultChord })` so the shortcut
editor can see them and the engine owns default resolution.

View keydown handlers still dispatch DOM-locally to the focused canvas, grid, or
other view surface, preserving the editable-field guard that the global engine
cannot provide for unmodified single keys. But they resolve the active chord
through `getBinding`: explicit user bindings win, explicit persisted `null`
means unbound, static `DEFAULT_KEYMAP` entries cover app-lifetime actions, and
registration defaults cover mount-time view-local actions.

Keep registered view actions editor-visible without making them window-dispatchable:
register them under a context the shell never activates, add the context to the
editor's label/order metadata, and dispatch DOM-locally with
`resolveViewKey`/`getBinding` inside the focused view. A registered `run()`
surface guard is too late because `handleKeydown` has already matched and called
`preventDefault`; see [the dispatch-ineligible context lesson](/lessons/first-class-view-defaults-window-dispatch-surface.md).

Do not keep a parallel view fallback resolver that treats `null` as both
"no default" and "explicit unbind". Registration defaults are part of the action
registration contract, as captured in [the dynamic registration default lesson](/lessons/dynamic-action-registration-default-chords.md).

When a view resolver yields a local default to explicit bindings elsewhere, its
anti-shadowing scan must use the engine's same-context/global collision rule;
see [the context-aware suppression lesson](/lessons/view-default-suppression-context-collision.md).

Structural keys such as Enter, Escape, and arrows stay hard-coded when they are
focus semantics rather than shortcuts.
