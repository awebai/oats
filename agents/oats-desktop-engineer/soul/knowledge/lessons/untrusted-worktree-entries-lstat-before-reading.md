# The trap

Desktop viewers inspect files from worktrees that may be untrusted. Reading an untracked entry before checking its filesystem type can follow a symlink out of the workspace or block forever on a FIFO/device.

# Rule

`lstat` untracked worktree entries before reading their contents:

- if the entry is a symlink, render the link target text via `readlink` instead of following it;
- if the entry is a FIFO, device, or other non-regular file, skip it.
