title: Anchor every tmux target the desktop constructs
description: tmux prefix-matches unanchored targets, so desktop code should build `=session:=window` through a validating helper for targets that accept anchors and fail loudly when the exact window is gone.

`tmux -t session:window` is not exact. Prefix matching applies to
`attach-session` as much as destructive commands: if roster data is stale and
the intended window is gone, tmux can attach a desktop terminal to a similarly
named live window. That routes user keystrokes into the wrong agent instead of
showing the renderer's existing "could not attach" banner.

The desktop terminal path in [Desktop terminal is a direct tmux attach via
node-pty](/decisions/desktop-terminal-direct-attach.md) should construct attach targets
with `tmuxAttachTarget(session, window)` in `packages/desktop/tmux-target.mjs`.
The helper validates both components with a conservative charset that rejects
`:` and `=` (tmux target syntax) and returns `=session:=window`.

Regression coverage should prove live tmux behavior, not just string shape: with
only window `reviewer-15c135c` present, an anchored target for `reviewer-1` must
be refused while the exact window name resolves.

# Rule

Every tmux `-t` target constructed by the desktop — attach, kill, list, or send
— should be `=`-anchored and component-validated when that command accepts exact
anchors. When touching tmux code, grep for constructed `-t` arguments that lack
`=` anchoring; failures should be loud (tmux "can't find window", then the
existing renderer banner), never silent mis-attachments.

Do not blindly add `=` to tmux commands that reject exact anchors. The
[link-window viewer isolation](/lessons/desktop-terminal-link-window-viewer-isolation.md)
path must set viewer-local options (`prefix`, `prefix2`, and `key-table`) with
`set-option -t <viewer>`, because `set-option -t =<viewer>` is not accepted.
That exception is only safe for the desktop-created viewer names, which are
unique and random; source session/window targets still need exact anchored
helpers.
