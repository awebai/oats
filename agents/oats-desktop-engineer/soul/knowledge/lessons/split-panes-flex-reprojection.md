# Split panes as flex-cell reprojection of existing tab panes

For the split-panels feature (branch oats-desktop-engineer/split-panels), the
cheapest correct design was NOT a separate pane tree: keep tabs as the single
source of terminal identity and make a split a pure state object
`{ orientation, members: [tabId], pending }` (renderer/split-layout.mjs).
The shell projects it in `activateTab`: member panes get `.active` +
`.split-cell` and `#tabhost` gets `display:flex` row/col.

Why this preserved the earned invariants for free:

- **Identity/dedup untouched**: the pending split slot absorbs the NEXT
  terminal tab activated through the normal open path (sidebar/palette →
  resolveTerminalOpen → addTab), so a split can never host an unresolved or
  duplicate identity.
- **FitAddon refit for free**: terminal-tab.mjs's ResizeObserver fires on any
  pane resize, but its fit gate is `isActive() = paneEl.classList.contains("active")`
  — split members must keep `.active` (shown = selected || inSplit) or hidden
  members never refit. `aria-selected`/tabIndex stay single-selection.
- **Cleanup**: `removeSplitTab` collapses to `null` (single pane) below two
  panes; workspace switch nulls the split because members are
  workspace-scoped terminal tabs.

# Model-DOM parity and close fallback gotchas

Merged-state review 156cbc7 found two split-specific defects that the split
model must continue to guard against:

- The renderer owns one `splitEmptyEl` placeholder, so the model must not accrue
  `pending > 1` invisible slots. A second split request while a placeholder is
  already pending should only re-orient that pending slot to what the DOM can
  display, not accumulate hidden state up to the cap.
- When closing the active split member, choose an adjacent surviving member
  (`adjacentSplitMember`, next then previous) before `removeSplitTab` forgets
  the closed member. Only then use the generic `fallbackTabForContext` fallback.
  The regression must include an unrelated newer tab, or recency fallback can
  hide the split by activating that unrelated terminal.

# Selection wiring gotcha

Visible split panes are an interaction surface independent of the tab strip.
Review 8443068 caught a bug where `activeTab` changed only through tab-strip
triggers: a user could click and type in pane A while tab B stayed selected, so
`tabs.close` and later split actions targeted the wrong terminal.

`wireSplitPaneSelection` fixes that by installing `pointerdown` and `focusin`
listeners on every tab pane. When the pane is a visible, non-selected split
member, those listeners call `activateTab(id)`. This selection must not steal DOM
focus (`activateTab` does not focus), and `renderSplit` must not re-append panes
that are already in place: re-inserting a node on pointerdown can tear it out of
the DOM mid-click.

CSS gotcha: `.tab-pane` is `position:absolute; inset:0` — split cells must
override with `position:relative; inset:auto; flex:1 1 0; min-width/height:0`
or flex sizing does nothing.
