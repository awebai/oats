title: Split request generations by independently superseding request kind
description: Do not let a child selection request share the same generation token as the roster refresh that populates it; each request kind gets its own counter, and a parent refresh may cancel child loads but child loads must not cancel the parent refresh.

# The race

Brain's roster refresh (`loadAgents()`) and per-selection brain fetch (`load()`) once shared one generation counter. After a workspace switch started `/api/agents`, the stale selector was still enabled; changing that stale selector bumped the shared counter, so the in-flight roster response failed its own generation check and the old workspace's agents stayed stranded in the new workspace.

# Durable pattern

1. Give each independently superseding request kind its **own** generation counter. A roster refresh and a per-selection fetch do not supersede each other symmetrically, so they must not share one token.
2. Let parent refreshes retire child work when they replace the child's input set: bump the per-selection generation when the roster is about to be replaced.
3. Do not let child work retire the parent refresh. A selection change may cancel older selection fetches, but it must not invalidate the roster request that will repopulate the selector.
4. Disable a control while an async refresh is replacing its contents, so stale interactions cannot race the refresh with old options.
5. Release that disabled-control lock on every current completion path, including failures, but only when the completing roster request still owns the lock; see [Release async UI locks only on owned completion paths](/lessons/release-ui-locks-every-exit-path.md).

# Regression shape

Hold `/api/agents` during a workspace switch, fire a change event on the still-stale selector, then resolve the roster. The new roster must populate and the selector must be re-enabled. Also reject the current roster refresh and assert the selector unlocks, then reject a superseded refresh while a newer refresh is in flight and assert the stale failure neither paints nor unlocks the newer refresh. The test fails if `loadAgents()` and `load()` share one generation token, if stale selector interactions remain possible while the roster refresh is in flight, or if the error path forgets the owned unlock.
