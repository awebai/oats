title: Bounded OS resources spawned per user action need a hard cap in the owning process
description: Renderer-side tab dedupe is best-effort UX, not a resource bound; pty and tmux-viewer ceilings must be deduped and capped in the Electron main process that owns them.

Opening many agent terminals in one Desktop session once spawned one attached tmux
viewer session plus one `node-pty` process per `term:open` call until the
operator laptop hung. The root cause was not tmux itself: `term:open` created a
fresh `oatsdesk-<pid>-*` viewer session and pty on every call, with no ceiling and
no reuse by target.

Renderer tab dedupe by `(ws, instance)` is only best-effort UX scoped to the
current workspace tab list. Reconnects, re-renders, stale async completions, IPC
bypass, or many distinct instances can still accumulate OS resources without a
bound.

# Rule

Any bounded OS resource created per user action must have its dedupe and ceiling
enforced in the process that owns the resource. For the desktop terminal path in
[Desktop terminal is a direct tmux attach via node-pty](/decisions/desktop-terminal-direct-attach.md),
that owner is the Electron main process: it owns the pty map and isolated tmux
viewer sessions, so it must reject or reuse `term:open` before creating more.
The renderer may dedupe tabs for convenience, but it cannot be the resource
bound.

A safe shape is a pure, synchronous registry around terminal creation:

- `plan(targetKey)` returns reuse, cap, or create without mutating. The caller
  creates the pty only for create, then commits the slot.
- Because the main-process IPC handler is synchronous end to end for terminal
  open, plan → create → commit is atomic on the single main thread; concurrent
  IPC opens cannot interleave to exceed the cap.
- IPC returns structured outcomes such as `{ id }`, `{ reused, id }`,
  `{ capped, active, max }`, or `{ error }`. Cap rejection should be visible and
  actionable (for example, "Close a terminal tab first"), not a silent eviction
  or extra create.
- `release()` runs on pty exit, tab close, and app quit so the slot is freed
  exactly once. If creation fails, commit nothing; partial viewer cleanup remains
  the opener's responsibility.

Tests should exercise the main-process resource boundary, not only renderer tab
state: same target opens collapse to one viewer, distinct targets cap and reject,
close frees a slot, create failure leaves the baseline unchanged, quit restores
baseline, and mutation checks fail when dedupe or cap is removed. Live tmux tests
must use an isolated `tmux -S` server and prove every durable source window
survives; never run resource-counting tmux tests against the operator's real tmux
server.
