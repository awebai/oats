title: No-CLI desktop server tests must hide the real oats CLI
description: Desktop server tests that expect cli-unavailable 503 must run the spawned server with an inert CLI environment, because an operator machine with a compatible installed oats binary can proceed past degradation and fail as a 409 domain error instead.

Running the repo-root gate (`npm test`) on an operator machine that has a
compatible `oats` CLI installed can make `test/desktop-server.test.mjs` ›
"/api/spawn validates" fail. The test asserts the mutation boundary degrades
with HTTP 503 and `cli-unavailable`, but the spawned desktop server's CLI probe
finds the real installed binary. The spawn attempt then runs and fails as a
domain error, observed as `409 !== 503`.

This was verified as pre-existing on a clean baseline of
`origin/feature/agent-relations` after `git stash`, so the failure is
environment-dependent rather than a code regression from the cluster work.

Tests that pin no-CLI degradation should give the spawned server an inert
environment, such as an emptied `PATH` or no persisted binary path, the same way
other CLI subprocess tests are guarded. Until the test is fixed, treat this
single failure as environmental when judging gate results on dev machines.
