title: Dynamic action registrations carry their own default chords
description: View-local actions that register at mount should supply defaultChord in the registration so getBinding can resolve overrides, static defaults, registration defaults, and explicit-null unbinds from one place.

# Defaults travel with dynamic registrations

Static tables (`DEFAULT_KEYMAP`) suit shell-level actions that exist for the
app's lifetime. View-local actions such as `hier.*` and `spawn.*` register at
view mount and dispose at unmount, so putting their defaults in the static table
would list bindings for actions that may never register.

Dynamic registration defaults belong on `registerAction({ defaultChord })`, not
in a view-local fallback resolver. `getBinding` is the one resolution point:

1. a persisted override wins, including explicit `null` from Backspace-unbind;
2. otherwise a static `DEFAULT_KEYMAP[id]` chord wins;
3. otherwise the registration's `defaultChord` wins;
4. otherwise the action is unbound.

`registerAction` canonicalizes the registration default through
`parseChord`/`chordToString` at registration time; invalid input becomes `null`
and does not throw. Because `matchEvent`, `findConflict`, and editor rows all
read `getBinding`, dispatch, conflict checks, and display stay consistent.

# Gotchas

- The two default mechanisms intentionally coexist: `DEFAULT_KEYMAP` is the
  canonical table for shipped defaults, and `defaultChord` is the API for
  dynamically registered actions. If both exist for an action, `DEFAULT_KEYMAP`
  wins by construction; do not simplify one side away without coordinator
  sign-off.
- `registerAction` and unregister must fire the keymap-change notifier: a mount
  that supplies a default chord changes effective bindings, and an open
  shortcuts editor must rerender.
- The editor's "is this the default?" check must compare against
  `DEFAULT_KEYMAP[id] ?? action.defaultChord`; otherwise untouched registration
  defaults show per-row reset buttons.
- Explicit-null persistence already round-trips through the sanitizer (`null` is
  a preserved override value), so unbind survives reload for
  registration-default actions with no extra storage work.
- During live migration, if a legacy view resolver remains, gate its fallback on
  "the engine does not know this action id," not on an effective binding of
  `null`; `null` can be the user's explicit Backspace-unbind and must not
  resurrect the default. Once production callers stop passing legacy chord
  fields, delete the fallback and its registry/context policing instead of
  preserving dormant compatibility in an exported resolver.
  See [Dormant compatibility paths in exported resolvers are liabilities, not safety](/lessons/dormant-compat-paths-exported-resolvers.md).
- First-class registration defaults can make a view action window-dispatchable
  if the shell activates the action's context. Do not rely on the registered
  `run()` to guard the surface: selection and `preventDefault` have already
  happened. Put view actions in dispatch-ineligible contexts that the window
  listener never activates, keep editor labels/order metadata for visibility,
  and let the local view handler dispatch with `resolveViewKey`.
