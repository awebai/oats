title: Guard async render completions on both success and error paths
description: Async renderer selections must mint a fresh generation for every user action and check one ownership predicate on both success and error completions, or stale rejections can overwrite a newer render.

# The bug

Brain's selection race showed two ways a request-generation guard can be
weakened without looking obviously wrong:

- `sel.change` called `load(name, gen)` with the current generation, so two
  different selections shared one token and the older request still appeared to
  own the render.
- The success path checked both selection and generation, but the catch path
  checked only generation, so a stale request's late rejection could paint its
  error over a newer selection's rendered brain.

# Durable pattern

Use the diff renderer's `owns()` shape as the house pattern for async view
renders:

1. Mint a **new** generation for every user action before dispatching work.
2. Define one ownership predicate that captures the generation, mounted-ness,
   and selected name for that dispatch.
3. Check that same predicate before **every** completion-side mutation: success
   renders, error renders, status writes, and cleanup that affects shared view
   state.
4. Treat selection-only and generation-only checks as incomplete. A generation
   token works only if each action receives a fresh token, and errors are just
   as capable of stale UI writes as successful responses.
5. Pick the generation's scope by the thing that can supersede itself. A
   per-modal token is too coarse when the same open modal can issue repeated
   async fills; each fill call needs its own monotonic request generation,
   captured at dispatch and checked before applying results.

# Regression pattern

Control response order with manually resolved promises. Start two overlapping
selection loads, resolve the newer load first, then complete the older load late
in both modes: stale success after newer render and stale rejection after newer
render. The newer render must survive both completions. For repeated async fills
inside one modal, keep the modal open, dispatch two fill requests, resolve the
newer deferred response first, and assert the older response cannot overwrite
it. Before trusting the coverage, mutation-check the test by reverting the guard
shape or generation minting and confirm the test fails.
