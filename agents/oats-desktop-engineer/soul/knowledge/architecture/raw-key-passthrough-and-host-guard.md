title: Raw key passthrough and the loopback Host/Origin guards
description: POST /api/keys is the panel's sole text-input path, sending browser keydown bytes into the logically focused pane via tmux send-keys -H, routing large or pasted payloads through load-buffer/paste-buffer, forcing a short-tail repaint so echo is visible, and enforcing loopback Host on every request plus loopback Origin on POSTs.

# Key byte path

The terminal-faithful session view translates browser key events to bytes on the
client, batches them briefly, and posts those bytes to `/api/keys`. This is the
panel's sole text-input path: there is no separate chat composer and no
`/api/send` endpoint.

Routing follows the panel's logical focused pane rather than DOM focus on a
terminal element. A window keydown/paste listener sends to `focusedPane()` when
`document.activeElement` is not a real editable control (`INPUT`, `TEXTAREA`,
`SELECT`, or `contentEditable`); any mousedown inside a pane claims logical
focus for that pane.

The client mapping is:

- Enter becomes `\r`, Backspace becomes `\x7f`, arrow keys become CSI `A`–`D`,
  Ctrl-letter chords become control bytes, and Alt prefixes the byte sequence
  with ESC.
- Cmd shortcuts stay in the browser; Cmd-B is the panel sidebar toggle, while
  Ctrl-B is delivered to the session as the tmux prefix.
- Pastes are sent with `{ paste: true }`; the server normalizes `\r\n?` to `\n`
  and delivers the whole text as one bracketed paste via `load-buffer` +
  `paste-buffer -p` — never as raw carriage returns a shell could execute
  line by line.
- Batches are coalesced for about 12ms before POSTing.

The server writes the byte stream with `tmux send-keys -H <hex...>` so tmux
receives raw bytes rather than key names, and no shell interpretation is
involved. Payloads larger than 512 chars use `load-buffer` plus
`paste-buffer -p`; hundreds of synchronous `send-keys -H` executions would
block the single-threaded server.

Server-side tmux targets must be built as validated exact matches
(`=session:=window`). Unanchored `-t session:window` can prefix-match a
similarly named live window after the roster goes stale, so key delivery and
interrupt/capture paths must fail closed instead of falling through to another
pane. See [Anchor tmux targets and avoid display-message for fail-closed reads](/lessons/tmux-anchored-targets-and-display-message-fallback.md).

The key queue is tagged with the instance selected when the user typed and the
request forwards the selected workspace as `?ws=`, so a mid-flight instance
switch or a duplicate instance name in another workspace does not leak queued
bytes into the wrong pane. See
[Scope instance-name endpoints by workspace ID](/lessons/workspace-scoped-instance-routing.md).

After each key flush, the UI treats typing as "show me the prompt": it sets a
short `snapUntil` window, forces a terminal refresh, and uses a small tail
capture so the prompt row and echo repaint quickly without fetching the full
scrollback on every keystroke. (Browser-panel-era lesson; the desktop's
direct node-pty attach renders echo natively, but any capture-pane-based
viewer must force-repaint after input.)

# Loopback Host/Origin guards

A hostile web page can DNS-rebind to `127.0.0.1`; with a key-injection endpoint
that would mean arbitrary terminal byte injection, and with file-serving GET
endpoints it can read workspace files. Every request requires a loopback `Host`.
POST endpoints also require a loopback `Origin` when an `Origin` header is
present. Requests failing that guard return 403.

The every-request Host check matters because GET APIs such as `/api/file` and
`/api/diff` are file-serving surfaces; see
[Loopback Host guard must cover GET file-serving APIs too](/lessons/loopback-host-guard-all-requests.md).
