title: Desktop deployment reader and mutation degradation after kernel bridge removal
description: The desktop deployment reader owns read-only deployment discovery after kernel bridge removal, mirrors first-class local souls under sibling local-agents/ directories, and leaves mutations to validation plus installed-CLI cli-unavailable degradation.

# Boundary

The packaged desktop backend must not depend on a framework checkout through
`FRAMEWORK_ROOT`/`lib/core.mjs`. Removing that bridge established that the
server's durable in-process surface is read-only deployment discovery, owned by
`packages/desktop/server/deployment.mjs`.

The app-owned reader covers the read seams the desktop server needs: resolving
`oats-config` into team context, computing team agent roots, ensuring a requested
root is one of the watched roots, listing local and capability agents, finding
local/capability agent definitions, parsing frontmatter, expanding capability
skill manifest paths, and listing instances. It is not a general kernel port.

# Reader behavior

The reader deliberately differs from the kernel where a packaged app must be
more tolerant or more self-contained:

- root discovery is read-only; `findAgentsRoot` never scaffolds missing state;
- malformed `oats-config`, `soul.yaml`, or capability manifests degrade to "not
  visible" because the desktop app observes deployments it does not own;
- marketplace manifest handling does not use hoisted framework-resource
  resolution, because a packaged app has no framework checkout;
- capability manifest paths still keep the realpath containment guard so
  manifest entries cannot escape their package root.

# Local souls

Kernel commit 030ad49 made local souls first-class: full souls with memory,
skills, and instances live in `<scope>/local-agents/`, a sibling of `agents/`
rather than nested inside it, and are auto-gitignored by the kernel. The desktop
reader mirrors those semantics:

- `localAgentsDirOf(root) = join(dirname(root), "local-agents")`; legacy nested
  `<root>/local-agents` and `<root>/tmp-agents` are still read.
- All-local scopes are deployments. `findRoot` walking up from inside
  `local-agents/` resolves to the canonical sibling `agents/` root even when it
  is absent, and team-scope member detection counts members that have only
  `local-agents/`.
- The public soul kind is `local`; old `kind: tmp` soul files normalize to
  `local` at read time, and spawn-card chips key off `kind === "local"`.
- Capability instance homes use the scope-sibling local-agents base too.
- While a branch's in-tree kernel predates the change, parity tests should
  compare kinds through a `tmp` to `local` normalizer and accept both
  instance-home locations; tighten those expectations when the kernel change
  lands on the branch.

A live check against `~/oats` showed local `ux-designer`, `memory-harvest`, and
`xx` entries in the roster, brain serving a local soul's skills and knowledge,
and `/api/file` serving a local soul's `AGENTS.md`.

# Mutation boundary

`spawnInstance` was the desktop server's mutation seam and did not move into the
reader. `POST /api/spawn` / `spawnAgent` keeps the validation half in process —
the `agentsRoot` allowlist and agent resolution still fail with meaningful
client errors — then crosses the shipped CLI adapter boundary. If discovery has
not found a compatible installed `oats` binary, the adapter throws a stable
`{ code: "cli-unavailable" }` and maps to HTTP 503.

Keep this validation-vs-degradation distinction testable at the installed-CLI
boundary: unknown roots or agents should remain validation failures, while a
missing compatible `oats` CLI is a stable service-unavailable degradation.

# Verification and regression traps

`test/desktop-deployment.test.mjs` proves reader parity against `lib/core.mjs` on
the live repo for team scope, roots, souls, capability agents, and instance
names. That comparison is valid while `packages/desktop` still lives in-tree;
when the desktop package moves out, freeze the comparison into fixtures instead.

Absence regressions that grep shipped sources for `lib/core.mjs` or
`FRAMEWORK_ROOT` also match explanatory comments. When a comment trips the
absence test, reword the comment (for example, "kernel module" or
"framework-root override") rather than weakening the test.
