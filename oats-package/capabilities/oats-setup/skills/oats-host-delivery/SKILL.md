# Host message delivery: Claude channels and the wake broker

Every host that runs messaging seats needs two delivery choices. Neither
has a safe default:

- **An unset `claudeChannelMode` starts every Claude home in development
  mode.** Nobody chose that.
- **A host with no wake broker gives every joined team poll-only receive,**
  and gives Codex and `delivery: session` homes no wakes at all.

`oats doctor` stays clean in both cases. This skill is the one place that
teaches both choices. `/oats-onboarding` card 4 makes them, card 8 checks
them, and the onboarding hand-back records them. The provider's side is
`/oats-aweb` §4 and §7.

What wakes each home (oats.aweb 1.15 and later):

| Home | Its primary identity is woken by | The broker is needed for |
|---|---|---|
| Claude, `delivery: channel` (the default) | the aweb channel plugin: [Choice 1](#choice-1-claude-channel-delivery) | its joined teams |
| pi, `delivery: channel` | its `@awebai/pi` extension | its joined teams |
| Codex, any delivery | the host wake broker | everything |
| any runtime, `delivery: session` | the host wake broker | everything |

A joined team's `receive: native` always means the broker, never a Claude or
pi channel. So **the host needs the broker as soon as one home on it has a
joined team, runs Codex, or uses `delivery: session`**:
[Choice 2](#choice-2-the-host-wake-broker).

**Record both choices** in the onboarding hand-back, each with the result of
its check:

```text
Claude channel delivery: approved | development (chosen: <reason>) | no Claude seats here
Host wake broker: installed (<manager> unit, aw <version>) | not needed (<why>) | declined (<who> accepts wake-daemon-not-running and poll-only joined teams on <homes>)
```

| Choice | Its check |
|---|---|
| approved | the approved route's **Success** list below, then the nonce exchange |
| development | the key is written in `oats-local.yaml` (from oats.aweb 1.28.0, readiness warns `claude-channel-mode-default` when it is not), and the home's readiness has neither `channel-dev-confirmation` (the last start recorded the confirmation `completed`) nor `claude-channels-unavailable`; then the nonce exchange |
| broker installed | Choice 2's **Check** |
| not needed, no Claude seats | nothing to check; revisit when the host gains such a home |
| broker declined | the hand-back names the accepted readiness problem and who accepted it |

## Choice 1: Claude channel delivery

Pick one for the host's Claude seats:

| Choice | Setting (`oats-local.yaml`, `settings.oats.aweb`) | When |
|---|---|---|
| **approved** (default for unattended hosts) | `claudeChannelMode: approved` | Use it whenever a human admin can write the managed-settings file, or the organization admin can set its two keys. [Steps below](#claude-channel-delivery-approved-route). |
| **development** (fallback) | `claudeChannelMode: development`, written explicitly | When the approved route is not available yet. Know its costs: [the development fallback](#the-development-fallback). |

For approved or development, write `claudeChannelMode`. A missing key is not
a choice: it is how hosts end up in development mode by accident. From
oats.aweb 1.28.0, readiness warns `claude-channel-mode-default` on such a
home (only on a home, because the soul-scope check cannot see the harness),
so `/oats-onboarding` card 8 is where it shows.

### Claude channel delivery (approved route)

With `claudeChannelMode: approved`, oats.aweb starts Claude with
`--channels plugin:aweb-channel@awebai-marketplace`. Claude then shows no
“WARNING: Loading development channels” prompt, because it admits the plugin
when a root-owned managed-settings file on the machine lists it.

- The route does not depend on the Claude version.
- There is no prompt for OATS to confirm. From OATS 0.52.0, development
  mode's prompt is confirmed by OATS itself (`docs/configuration.md`, “The
  development-channel confirmation”). On OATS 0.44 to 0.51 it needed the
  `launchPromptAnswers` consent.

The contract is `docs/configuration.md`, “Claude channel delivery: the
approved route”. The provider's behaviour and the receive proof are in
`/oats-aweb` §4.

**Prerequisites:** the intake selects Claude seats with channel delivery on
this host; a human admin with sudo on this machine, because OATS never writes
the managed-settings file; and which managed-policy source governs the
account. Claude reads its managed policy from the **first source present**:
server-managed settings (a claude.ai Team/Enterprise organization's admin
console), then an MDM profile (`com.anthropic.claudecode` on macOS), then the
file. On an account governed by server-managed settings or MDM the file is
ignored: the organization admin sets the same two keys there instead, and
steps 1–2 do not apply. Pro/Max accounts and plain API-key use have no
server-managed settings, so the file applies unless an MDM profile is
installed.

1. **Read what is there.** The file is `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
   on Linux and `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
   on macOS. Claude also reads drop-ins in `managed-settings.d/*.json` beside
   it. Read the file and any drop-ins before changing anything.
2. **The admin sets two keys**, in a file owned by root, mode 0644. The content
   is exactly:

   ```json
   {"channelsEnabled": true, "allowedChannelPlugins": [{"plugin": "aweb-channel", "marketplace": "awebai-marketplace"}]}
   ```

   If the file exists, merge these two keys into it and never overwrite its
   other keys (to an existing `allowedChannelPlugins`, add the aweb-channel
   entry), or put them in a drop-in of their own,
   `managed-settings.d/50-aweb.json` beside it (Claude merges the file first,
   then the drop-ins in name order; lists combine). **Setting
   `allowedChannelPlugins` replaces Anthropic's default channel allowlist on
   this host** (on 2026-10-08, the official discord, telegram, fakechat and
   imessage plugins): if the host uses any of them, list them too. Always
   include `channelsEnabled: true`: API-key users need it whenever any managed
   policy exists, and so do Team/Enterprise subscribers; Pro/Max ignore it.
   When no file exists yet, on Linux:

   ```bash
   sudo install -d -m 0755 /etc/claude-code
   echo '{"channelsEnabled": true, "allowedChannelPlugins": [{"plugin": "aweb-channel", "marketplace": "awebai-marketplace"}]}' \
     | sudo tee /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json >/dev/null
   sudo chown root /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json
   sudo chmod 0644 /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json
   ```

   On macOS:

   ```bash
   sudo install -d -m 0755 "/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode"
   echo '{"channelsEnabled": true, "allowedChannelPlugins": [{"plugin": "aweb-channel", "marketplace": "awebai-marketplace"}]}' \
     | sudo tee "/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json" >/dev/null
   sudo chown root "/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json"
   sudo chmod 0644 "/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json"
   ```

   Read it back: `ls -l` shows owner root and `-rw-r--r--`, and the file is
   valid JSON with both keys.
3. **The plugin.** `aweb-channel` is installed from the marketplace named
   `awebai-marketplace` (GitHub `awebai/claude-plugins`) and enabled, in the
   Claude config directory the host's Claude launch configuration uses (its
   `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, else `~/.claude`). The allowlist matches the
   marketplace by name. With that `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set in the shell:

   ```bash
   claude plugin marketplace add awebai/claude-plugins
   claude plugin install aweb-channel@awebai-marketplace
   claude plugin list   # aweb-channel@awebai-marketplace, enabled
   ```
4. **OATS settings**, in this host's `oats-local.yaml` under
   `settings.oats.aweb`: `claudeChannelMode: approved` (host-only), and
   `delivery: channel` for the whole host, or per spawn with
   `--provider oats.aweb delivery=channel`. With channel delivery, pi uses its
   `@awebai/pi` extension and Codex always uses the host broker.

**Effects:** a machine-wide Claude policy file and host settings; no home
changes. **Existing homes** keep the delivery and channel mode recorded at
their spawn: respawn a home to adopt this route. Never restart running agents
as part of setup without the operator's word.

**Success** (read at `/oats-onboarding` cards 6 and 8):

1. The spawn preview shows `settings.oats.aweb.claudeChannelMode: approved`
   and `delivery: channel`.
2. The started session shows no development prompt, and its banner shows
   “Channels (experimental) messages from plugin:aweb-channel@awebai-marketplace
   inject directly in this session”, followed by “restart without --channels
   to stop”. At normal terminal widths the banner wraps over two rows: look
   for each part, not for one string.
3. The banner says none of `not on the approved channels allowlist`,
   `not on your org's approved channels list`, `blocked by org policy` or
   `plugin not installed`.
4. Receive is proven only by the `/oats-aweb` nonce exchange.

**Next:** return to `/oats-onboarding` card 4's sync.

**Failure → cause → remedy:**

| What the session shows | Cause | Remedy |
|---|---|---|
| `not on the approved channels allowlist` | the effective managed policy has no `allowedChannelPlugins` (no file, the file not read, or the key missing), so Anthropic's default list applied | write or fix the file (steps 1–2) |
| `not on your org's approved channels list` | the effective policy has an `allowedChannelPlugins` without this plugin and marketplace pair: the names in the file are wrong, or a higher source (server-managed settings or MDM) supplies its own list | fix the entry, or have the organization admin add it |
| `blocked by org policy` (then “Inbound messages will be silently dropped”) | the effective policy lacks `channelsEnabled: true`, which Team/Enterprise subscribers need, and API-key use whenever any managed policy exists | add the key, or have the organization admin set it |
| `plugin:aweb-channel@awebai-marketplace · plugin not installed` | the plugin is not installed in the launch's Claude config directory | step 3 |
| no Channels banner at all, and no error | Claude disabled channels: a telemetry opt-out in the launch environment (`DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DO_NOT_TRACK` or `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`), or an account or organization without channels | remove the variable from the launch configuration's environment, or use an account with channels |
| the development prompt still appears | the home started in development mode, not approved: the host setting is missing, or the home was spawned before the change | step 4, then respawn the home |

When unsure, check in order: the preview's mode; which managed-policy source
governs the account; the file (the OS's path, root, 0644, valid JSON, both
keys, exact plugin and marketplace names); the plugin in the launch's config
directory. The admitted banner without a completed nonce exchange is not
receive: `/oats-aweb` §4.

**Limits:** channels are an Anthropic research preview, and Anthropic's
account-level feature flag gates them on every route; neither is an OATS
setting.

### The development fallback

`claudeChannelMode: development` makes oats.aweb start Claude with
`--dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:aweb-channel@awebai-marketplace`.
It needs no managed policy, so it works the day a host is set up. These are
its costs, and they are why it is a fallback and not the default for an
unattended host:

- **A prompt at every start.** Claude shows “WARNING: Loading development
  channels” whenever the home starts or restarts. OATS 0.52.0 and later
  confirms it once at launch by typing into the session
  (`docs/configuration.md`, “The development-channel confirmation”). Nothing
  else may answer it: not the provider, not the broker, not an agent.
- **A readiness warning that stays.** Readiness warns
  `channel-dev-confirmation` until the home's last start recorded
  `launchPrompts.status: completed`.
- **Inspection when a start goes wrong.** A start whose confirmation is
  `blocked` or `incomplete` leaves a session someone must inspect
  (`oats session inspect --home <home> --json`, and the kernel's
  `launch-prompt` readiness item) before anything is started again.
- **A telemetry opt-out leaves it silent.** Approved mode is disabled the
  same way. Here, Claude ignores the flag, the home has no channel delivery,
  and readiness warns `claude-channels-unavailable`.

Choose it by writing `claudeChannelMode: development`, never by leaving the
key out. To leave it later, set up the approved route, change the key, and
respawn the homes. A home keeps the mode it was spawned with.

## Choice 2: the host wake broker

The broker is aw's daemon, `aw wake run`. Each host user runs one, and it
serves every home registered with it. It types wakes into those homes'
terminals by running the OATS CLI (`oats session inspect` / `oats session
input`, which drive `tmux`). For each registration it also runs a delivery
child on Node.

Homes register themselves at spawn and launch, so there is nothing to do per
home. A registration made while the broker is down is written to its state
directory, and it takes effect when the broker starts. That directory is
`~/.config/aw/wake`, or `AW_WAKE_STATE_DIR` when that is set; the hooks and
the service must then see the same value.

**When the host needs it:** some home on it has a joined team (any runtime),
runs Codex, or uses `delivery: session`. Settle this at onboarding, and
revisit it whenever the host gains its first such home: a team join
(`/oats-teams`), a Codex seat, or `delivery: session`.

**What happens without it:**

- every home that needs the broker reads `unavailable` in readiness, with
  the problem `wake-daemon-not-running`;
- each of its joined teams also gets the warning `joined-team-poll-only`, and
  is reached only by polling its inbox;
- a Codex or `delivery: session` home is never woken.

**Who installs it.** The operator does, in their own terminal, as the user
who runs the instances, outside every instance home. Install it once aw
meets the provider's floor (after `/oats-onboarding` card 5, which can install
aw) and before card 6: from oats.aweb 1.28.0, card 6's readiness fails without
it for a soul with `delivery: session` or a join.

A per-user service starts with an almost empty PATH, so the unit names
these by absolute path:
- `aw` itself;
- `oats`, through `AW_WAKE_OATS_BIN` (without it, the broker looks for `oats`
  on PATH);
- a `PATH` that reaches `oats`, `node` (`oats` and the delivery child are
  Node programs) and `tmux`, followed by the host timer's list of usual
  directories.

Those paths must come from the operator's own shell. An agent's shell can
carry a session's own PATH, which is the same reason the host timer is
installed by the operator (`/oats-automations`, “One host timer, no
daemon”). An agent hands over the steps below and checks the result
afterwards. It never runs them itself.

Either way it is a user service. On Linux it stops at logout unless an admin
enables linger (`sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>`; the command warns
`wake-linger-off`, and `--linger-required` refuses instead). On macOS it runs
only while the user is logged in at the Mac (an unattended Mac needs automatic
login), and it is installed from that desktop login: over ssh, `launchctl
bootstrap` can fail after the plist is written (`E_WAKE_UNIT`); rerun it there.

### Install with the command (oats.aweb 1.28.0 and later)

From the deployment directory, in the operator's own shell:
1. `oats aweb wake install --plan` prints the unit and what it would do.
2. `oats aweb wake install` takes `aw`, `oats` and `tmux` (a warning if
   missing) from that shell's PATH, and the kernel's node. It writes the
   per-user unit `ai.aweb.wake` (systemd `--user` or a LaunchAgent) with the
   PATH and `AW_WAKE_OATS_BIN` above, starts it,
   and prints `PASS wake broker <version> (<manager> unit <path>)` once the
   daemon runs at that `aw`'s version.
3. `oats aweb wake status` reports the unit, the daemon, and this
   deployment's homes that need the broker, each registered or not.

Rerunning `install` re-renders the unit and restarts the daemon: that is the
restart after an aw upgrade. `oats aweb wake uninstall` removes only the unit
`install` wrote.

Refusals and warnings: `/oats-aweb` §7 and the package's `docs/wake-service.md`.
A host that followed the hand-written unit below (oats.setup 2.6.0) gets **`E_WAKE_UNIT_CONFLICT`** on its first
`install`: that unit has no install marker, even at the `ai.aweb.wake` path,
and `install` never takes it over. To move to the command, retire the old
unit with the steps the message prints, then rerun `install`:
- Linux: `systemctl --user disable --now <label>.service`, then remove the file;
- macOS: `launchctl bootout gui/<uid>/<label>`, then remove the file.

### Fallback: a hand-written unit

For a provider older than 1.28.0, or an operator who keeps a unit of their own.

#### Before installing

```bash
command -v aw oats node tmux   # in the operator's terminal: the absolute paths for the unit
aw version                     # at least the provider's floor (1.36.33 from oats.aweb 1.26.0)
aw wake status --json          # daemon_running must be false before the service takes over
```

Look for a unit that already runs the broker, with the line for this OS:

```bash
grep -l "wake run" ~/.config/systemd/user/*.service                              # Linux
grep -rlE 'ai\.aweb\.wake|<string>wake</string>' ~/Library/LaunchAgents        # macOS
```

- **A broker already running** (`daemon_running: true`) with no unit was
  started by hand. Stop it (`kill <daemon_pid>` from the status) and read
  the status again. Otherwise the service's own start exits at once, because
  a second `aw wake run` exits 0 when one is already running.
- **A unit that search finds** already supervises the broker. Keep it:
  compare it with the unit below (its PATH especially), then use the restart
  and check steps. Replacing it is the operator's decision, made explicitly:
  stop and remove the old unit first.
- **Paths.** Prefer stable ones: a version manager's per-version directory
  is gone after an upgrade (see “After an aw upgrade”).

In the units below:
- `<AW>`, `<OATS>` and `<HOME>` are the absolute paths of `aw`, of `oats` and
  of the user's home;
- `<DIRS>` is the directories holding `aw`, `oats`, `node` and `tmux`, joined with `:`;
- `<FALLBACK>` is the host timer's list, `/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`.

#### Linux (systemd --user)

Write `~/.config/systemd/user/ai.aweb.wake.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=aweb host wake broker

[Service]
ExecStart="<AW>" wake run
Environment="PATH=<DIRS>:<FALLBACK>"
Environment="AW_WAKE_OATS_BIN=<OATS>"
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

systemd expands `%` in these values and `$` in `ExecStart`: write a literal
`%` as `%%`, and a `$` in `ExecStart` as `$$`. Then:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now ai.aweb.wake.service
systemctl --user status ai.aweb.wake.service --no-pager | head -5
loginctl show-user "$USER" -p Linger   # Linger=no: the service stops when the user's last session ends
```

#### macOS (launchd)

Write `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.aweb.wake.plist`. launchd does not expand
`~`, so every path in it is absolute, the log path included.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key><string>ai.aweb.wake</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array><string><AW></string><string>wake</string><string>run</string></array>
  <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
  <dict>
    <key>PATH</key><string><DIRS>:<FALLBACK></string>
    <key>AW_WAKE_OATS_BIN</key><string><OATS></string>
  </dict>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
  <key>KeepAlive</key><true/>
  <key>StandardOutPath</key><string><HOME>/Library/Logs/ai.aweb.wake.log</string>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key><string><HOME>/Library/Logs/ai.aweb.wake.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Run these at the Mac's desktop login, where the `gui/<uid>` domain exists:

```bash
plutil -lint ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.aweb.wake.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.aweb.wake.plist
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/ai.aweb.wake | grep -m1 state   # state = running
```

### After an aw upgrade

A running daemon keeps the code it started with until it restarts. Restart it
after every aw upgrade, and also after `oats`, Node or tmux moves. With the
command, rerun `oats aweb wake install`: it re-renders the paths and restarts.
With a hand-written unit, edit its paths first, then:

```bash
systemctl --user restart ai.aweb.wake.service           # Linux; after editing the unit: daemon-reload first
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.aweb.wake        # macOS; after editing the plist: bootout, then bootstrap
```

Readiness warns `wake-daemon-outdated` only when the daemon is below the
provider's floor. A daemon above the floor but older than the `aw` on PATH
shows only in check 1 below, where `daemon_version` differs from `aw version`.

A restart is safe at any time. The daemon re-reads its registrations, and
mail that was not yet presented is raised again from the server's unread
state.

### Check

The onboarding hand-back records these results.

```bash
aw version
aw wake status --json              # daemon_running, daemon_version_state, daemon_version, instances
oats readiness --home <abs home> --json   # for each home that needs the broker
```

From oats.aweb 1.28.0, `oats readiness --soul <soul>` (card 6) fails with
`wake-daemon-not-running` or `wake-daemon-version-unknown` when the soul's
settings use `delivery: session` or a join; a per-spawn `--provider` setting or
a Codex seat is not visible there. `oats aweb wake status` lists every home
that needs the broker.

1. `aw wake status --json` shows `daemon_running: true`,
   `daemon_version_state: "reported"`, and a `daemon_version` equal to what
   `aw version` prints.
2. For every home that needs the broker, readiness has:
   - the oats.aweb item `ready`, with no `wake-*` or `receive-*` problem;
   - none of the warnings `wake-daemon-outdated` or `joined-team-poll-only`;
   - the home listed in the status's `instances`.
3. Receive is proven only by a nonce exchange to one identity the broker
   wakes: a joined team's identity, or a Codex or session home
   (`/oats-aweb` §4, “Receive verification and recovery”). Readiness and
   status rows prove the route, not delivery.

**A false problem on oats.aweb 1.27.2.** Readiness reports `wake-status-stale`
(and so `unavailable`, with `joined-team-poll-only`) for every home that
needs the broker, even while the broker runs and delivers
([oats-aweb#116](https://github.com/awebai/oats-aweb/issues/116)). oats.aweb
1.27.3 fixes it. Move the pin (`/oats-package-pins`). Homes composed on
1.27.2 keep the false problem until they are respawned.

### Failure → cause → remedy

| What you see | Cause | Remedy |
|---|---|---|
| `wake-daemon-not-running` | no service, or it is crash-looping | install it; read its log: `journalctl --user -u ai.aweb.wake.service -n 50`, or `~/Library/Logs/ai.aweb.wake.log` |
| `daemon_version` differs from `aw version`, or `wake-daemon-outdated` | aw was upgraded and the daemon was not restarted | restart it (above) |
| `wake-daemon-version-unknown` | the running daemon is too old to report its version | upgrade aw, then restart |
| the log says `oats`, `node` or `tmux` is not found, or session inspection fails | the unit's `PATH` or `AW_WAKE_OATS_BIN` misses it, or points at a moved version | fix the paths, reload, restart; or rerun `oats aweb wake install` |
| the service restarts every few seconds, and the status names a `daemon_pid` that is not the service's | a broker started by hand is running | stop that one; the service then owns the broker |
| `joined-team-poll-only` with the broker running | the readiness problem beside it names the route's fault | `wake-target-missing`: restart the home (with the operator's word) so it registers again; `wake-target-paused`: `aw wake resume`; `wake-stream-unavailable`: the identity or its stream, see the daemon's log |
| status is running but one home gets no wakes | its registration or stream, not the server | read the daemon's log for that identity's path (“stream connected” versus “stream unavailable”); a status row proves absence, never its cause |

## Never

- Leave `claudeChannelMode` unset, unless the host's Claude seats use
  `delivery: session`.
- Write Claude's managed-settings file, or install, restart or remove the
  broker's service, from an agent's shell. Hand the steps to the admin or
  the operator, and check the result afterwards.
- Take over or delete a broker unit somebody else wrote.
- Restart or respawn running agents without the operator's word.
- Treat a banner, a readiness answer or a status row as proof of receive.
  Only the nonce exchange proves it.
