 *  (lib/claim.mjs CLAIM_UNWRITABLE_CODES: a full disk, a directory that is not writable), is
 *  read where it would have been taken, and the stop goes on when nobody holds it, holding
 *  nothing for that target and saying so (STOP_WARNINGS). In this order:
 *  1. the plan, read for its targets and for the home of the receipt;
 *  2. a receipt recorded under the same key is replayed (STORED_UNDER_KERNEL_CODES,
 *     replayedResults): read-only, before any claim;
 *  3. the claim of every target, in one fixed order (by claim path), so that two overlapping
 *     stops cannot each hold half: one wins the first file both want, the other is refused at
 *     once and releases what it took. A holder is answered here, before a stale plan:
 *     E_INSTANCE_RETIRING beside a retire, E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY beside a stop, with the plan read
 *     before the claims. A claim that is only read answers the same for whoever holds it;
 *  4. the plan again, under the claims: the plan that is acted on. Every target IT names is held
 *     by this apply before anything is done: one it does not hold (a child recorded, or readable
 *     again, since the read of 1) sends the apply back to 3 with this plan's targets, every claim
 *     released first, so that the order of 3 holds (STOP_CLAIM_PASSES bounds it). A target whose
 *     claim was only read counts as covered, and is read once more here, with the same read: the
 *     last look before the first signal, answered before a stale plan as a holder is in 3. Then
 *     the one comparison with the revision the caller sent: a child retired or re-made, a session started
 *     or ended, a self-retire scheduled since the plan was shown is E_PLAN_STALE with the fresh
 *     plan (the guarded retire's pattern, core RETIRE_UNDER_CLAIM). The plan's own refusals come
 *     from this read too: the instance itself retired since (E_SESSION_UNKNOWN), its record no
 *     longer readable (E_UNIDENTIFIED_INSTANCE_HOME);
 *  5. a scheduled self-retire the caller was shown: E_INSTANCE_RETIRING;
 *  6. a marker an older kernel left in a target is removed (leftoverStopMarkerPath);
 *  7. each target is stopped, deepest first; 8. the receipt is written; 9. the claims are released.
 *  Everything through 6 is before any effect. From 7 on no answer says that nothing happened: a
