/** What a start's launch environment was (feature session-resume, #1559): the record that lets a
 *  resume refuse to start under a `fromEnv` value that changed since the start it brings back.
 *  Kernel-private files in the home, not a contract:
 *   - `.oats-start-env.key`: 32 random bytes, mode 0600, made once, at the first start that records.
 *     It never leaves the home: never logged, answered or put in an event.
 *   - `.oats-start-env.json`: `{ startId, digests: { <fromEnv source name>: <hex HMAC-SHA256(key,
 *     value)> } }`, written whole (tmp + rename) at every start that renders a recipe, for that
 *     start's id; `digests` is `{}` for a launch with no reference. A value is never written: a
 *     `fromEnv` value may be a credential, and only its keyed one-way digest is kept.
 *  The record is best effort: a write that fails leaves the previous record (for another start) or
 *  none, which a resume reads as unverified. Dependency-free: the start, the spawn and the sweep's
 *  `--plan` read and write it through here. */
