/** The `worktree` lifecycle event's runner (#796), and the process facts its
 *  recovery reads. Dependency-free; the caller (lib/core.mjs for a spawn,
 *  lib/worktree.mjs for `oats worktree add`) builds each hook's environment.
 *
 *  Only this event runs this way. Every other hook keeps `runLifecycleHooks`
 *  (execSync, buffered, 120 s, cwd the home). A `worktree` hook installs
 *  dependencies, so it may run for minutes and print a lot:
 *    - its cwd is the new tree; stdin is /dev/null; it has no terminal;
 *    - it is spawned detached (its own session and process group), so a
 *      timeout or an interrupt ends the whole group (terminateGroup);
 *    - stdout and stderr go to `<home>/.oats/logs/worktree-<p|work>-<cap>.log`
 *      (0600, truncated per run) and, when asked (`oats worktree add`), to the
 *      kernel's stderr — never its stdout, which holds only the envelope;
 *    - the result is the exit status; of the last stdout line's JSON only
 *      `warning` is read, and `env` is a contract error (as at retire).
 *  The timeout is fixed (WORKTREE_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS). OATS_TEST_WORKTREE_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS
 *  is a test seam, not a setting. */
