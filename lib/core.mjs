/**
 * lib/core.mjs — runtime-neutral OATS library (souls & instances, config cascade,
 * capabilities, lifecycle hooks). No pi imports: consumed by both the standalone
 * `oats` CLI (bin/oats.mjs) and the pi extension adapter (extension/index.ts).
 *
 * An "agents root" is the CLOSEST directory named `agents/` found by walking up
 * from cwd (or $PI_AGENTS_ROOT); a scope with only `local-agents/` resolves to
 * its (possibly absent) sibling `agents/` as the canonical root — OATS is fully
 * usable with local agents alone. The root's parent is the "workspace" (scope);
 * soul `repo` paths resolve relative to it.
 *
 * Layout:
 *   <scope>/agents/<agent>/soul/       canonical body: soul.yaml, AGENTS.md (canonical; CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md),
 *                                      skills/, knowledge/ (OKF bundle)
 *   <scope>/agents/<agent>/instances/<inst>/  instance HOME: generated AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md,
 *                                      soul → soul dir, .agents/skills (canonical; .claude/skills → ../.agents/skills),
 *                                      work/ (worktree or symlink), TASK.md, STATE.md, log.md, notes/, instance.json
 *   <scope>/local-agents/<name>/       LOCAL souls — same soul/ + instances/ shape and full memory,
 *                                      but uncommitted by contract: the dir is created on first use and
 *                                      auto-gitignored when the scope is a git repo. Legacy nested
 *                                      <root>/local-agents/ and <root>/tmp-agents/ are still read.
 *
 * soul.yaml (flat key: value):
 *   name, description, kind (persistent|local), type (optional agent-type/family, targeted by config),
 *   repo (path rel. to workspace or absolute),
 *   work (worktree|checkout|attached), runtime (pi|claude|codex), model (pi model pattern, optional)
 *   (attached as soul default is for service agents — spawn must supply workDir)

 * governs it, whether it is trusted. They are internal annotations, so they must
 * be unforgeable: an artifact that can write them into its own on-disk document
 * asserts its own provenance. That was reachable — a capability whose `oats.json`

 *

 * unreachable from disk. Package manifests do not need this — `loadPackageManifestAt`
 * already rejects every key outside `PACKAGE_MANIFEST_KEYS` — and neither do
