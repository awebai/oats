/**
 * This computer's deployments (docs/workspaces.md "This computer's deployments"; awebai/oats#1390).
 *
 * One per-user list of the deployments on this machine, `~/.oats/config/deployments.json`
 * (OATS_HOME_DIR overrides `~/.oats`, as for the server registry). It holds facts only: each row's
 * canonical path, when it joined and how. Which deployments a client has open stays with that
 * client, and remote machines stay in the server registry (lib/servers.mjs).
 *
 * Who writes it: `oats onboard` (what it created), `oats deployments add|remove|import`, and any
 * kernel command that resolves a deployment that is not listed yet (listResolved, which the CLI
 * sets to observe the command's own resolution: lib/resolved-deployment.mjs). A row `oats deployments remove` took out is kept as a tombstone (`removed`,
 * `removedAt`): nothing automatic lists that path again, and only an explicit add (or an onboard)
 * brings it back.
 *
 * The first command that touches the list imports `$HOME/Agents` once (the deployments directly
 * inside it), under the same lock, and records `imports["agents-dir"]` even when there is nothing
 * to import. A command whose import could not run fails: it never answers a list that skipped it.
 *
 * Concurrency: every read-modify-write holds `config/deployments.lock` (withDirLock), waits up to
 * 3 s for it and re-reads inside it; each write replaces the file atomically. Readers take no lock:
 * they read a regular file only, without following a link, up to 1 MiB. A row's `state` is an
 * existence check: no deployment's content is read here.
