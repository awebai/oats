/** The claim: one file that says which process is doing a thing that must happen once at a time.
 *  One protocol, used by `oats worktree add|remove` (the purpose's claim, lib/worktree.mjs
 *  `withClaim`) and by `oats retire` and `oats instance stop` (the home's claim, lib/core.mjs
 *  `claimHomeFor`).
 *
 *  Unlike lib/dir-lock.mjs, a claim left by a process that died is taken over, so a killed command
 *  can always be run again: the owner is named by pid AND start time (processLiveness), never by a
 *  pid alone, and a holder whose start cannot be read is never taken for gone.
 *
 *  - Taking it: the owner's facts `{ pid, processStart, nonce, at }`, with what the caller adds to
 *    them (`facts`), are written to a private file and hard-linked to `path`, which fails if
 *    `path` exists. So a claim is never seen without its owner, and the nonce makes each holding
 *    distinct, even for the same process.
 *  - Its owner is alive: waited for up to `waitMs`, then refused (`busy`).
 *  - Its owner is gone (processLiveness "gone", which a zombie is too; "unknown" is refused, never
 *    taken over): the claim is removed under a second claim, `<path>.reclaim-<owner nonce>`, taken
 *    by this same protocol.
 *    Its holder re-reads `path` and removes it only if it still names that owner. Nothing else
 *    removes another's claim: its owner never releases it, and a new acquirer cannot write over an
 *    existing file. Two takeovers of one dead owner are therefore serialized, and neither removes
 *    a claim made after it read. A takeover cut short leaves its own claim behind, which the next
 *    takeover takes over in turn, up to CLAIM_MAX_DEPTH nested levels.
 *  - Its owner is gone and the file cannot be taken over: refused with `cannotTakeOver`, which
 *    says that the holder is gone and what to do with the file. Never with `busy`: nobody is
 *    running (awebai/oats#874). That is a file whose `nonce` is not the 32 hex digits a claim
 *    carries, so no takeover can be serialized on it; the claim of a takeover nested
 *    CLAIM_MAX_DEPTH deep; and, which comes first on the file systems there are, one whose
 *    takeover claim the system refuses to name: each nested level adds 41 bytes to the name, so a
 *    chain of four or five dead takeovers reaches the limit of a file name (ENAMETOOLONG). The
 *    refusal names the file whose takeover could not be named, the one to remove.
 *  - A step the holder recorded in its claim (recordInClaim) is ended by a takeover first
 *    (`endHolderStep`), which refuses, keeping the claim, if the step cannot be ended.
 *  - Once a takeover has ended a holder's step, no later answer of that acquisition says that
 *    nothing was done: whatever it is then refused with, or fails on, is answered
 *    E_LIFECYCLE_FAILED, naming first what was ended. Every refusal is handed what was ended so
 *    far (`ended`, the clauses in order; empty before any effect) and writes its own sentence
 *    for it (lib/errors.mjs nothingAfter, afterEndedSteps; lifecycleBusy takes `ended`): no
 *    message is rewritten here. A refusal that was made without them is still answered after
 *    them (claimUnavailable). A refusal before any effect stays what its caller made it.
 *  - Released by unlinking `path`, only while it still names this holding.
 *  - A claim that could not be WRITTEN is marked as that, for the one caller that then reads it
 *    in place of taking it (`oats instance stop --apply`: lib/core.mjs claimHomeFor). The mark is
 *    made at the place, one of the claim's writes (claimWrite: its directory, its private file,
 *    its link, and the same of a takeover's own claim), for the system's code as it was thrown
 *    there, one of CLAIM_UNWRITABLE_CODES; it travels on the refusal (unwritableCode). No reader
 *    of an answer's code, words or details can tell this failure from another, and none tries:
 *    a defect, and a claim that could not be removed, are E_LIFECYCLE_FAILED too. Whether
 *    anybody holds a claim that was not taken is read by claimUnheld, which says "nobody" only
 *    of a path that is absent or of a claim whose holder is verifiably gone.
 *  - A claim is read back as whatever JSON is in its file, and the file is where others than its
 *    writer can write. Who holds it, and whether that process lives, is decided on the record as
 *    it is; what an ANSWER shows of it is only what shownHolder allows, never the file's text.
 *  - An unreadable claim file is never removed: the command is refused, naming the file. So is a
 *    path that exists and keeps reading as absent (a dangling symbolic link where the claim
 *    belongs), once the retries below are spent.
 *  - Every pass that does not take the claim falls through one check of its time and one pause
 *    (takeClaim): none starts the next pass at once, so no state of the path makes it spin, and
 *    each ends in a refusal within `waitMs` plus CLAIM_FREED_RETRIES pauses (awebai/oats#874).
 *    A claim that every one of those passes found held again by a process that is gone, after it
 *    took the one before over, is refused with `heldAgain`: an ordinary claim, which the next
 *    run takes over.
 *  - A claim that cannot be taken for a reason of the system's (its directory cannot be made, its
 *    private file cannot be written, the link fails otherwise than because the claim exists) is
 *    refused as E_LIFECYCLE_FAILED (claimUnavailable), never with the system's code
 *    (awebai/oats#874): the claim was not taken, so nothing was done.
 *
 *  Everything is synchronous. What is the caller's own goes in `opts`. Each refusal is an error
 *  whose message states its effects, once: in the caller's words for "nothing was done" before
 *  any effect, and as "nothing else was done" when `ended`, its last argument, names what this
 *  acquisition's takeovers ended before it:
 *    busy(holder, unknown, at, ended)       the refusal for a holder that lives (`unknown` unset)
 *                                           or whose liveness cannot be read (`unknown` is the
 *                                           reason); `at` is the claim file that names it
 *    ownStartUnreadable(reason, at, ended)  the refusal when this process's own start cannot be
 *                                           read, so it could not hold `at` verifiably
 *    unreadableClaim(at, ended)             the refusal for a claim file that does not parse, or
 *                                           for a path that exists and cannot be read as one
 *    cannotTakeOver(holder, at, why, ended) the refusal for a holder that is gone and whose claim
 *                                           file `at` this kernel cannot take over; `why` is a
 *                                           clause saying what stops it
 *    heldAgain(holder, at, times, ended)    the refusal for a claim that this command found
 *                                           without a live holder `times` times and that was
 *                                           taken again each time, the last time by `holder`,
 *                                           which is gone: nothing is wrong with `at`
