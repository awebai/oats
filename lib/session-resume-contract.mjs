/** The names of the session-resume contract (feature session-resume, #1559): the strings a client
 *  reads in `sessionEnd`, in a `session start --resume` answer's `resume` object and in the rows of
 *  `oats session resume` (docs/desktop-cli-api.md). Both product sides settle them together
 *  (awebai/oats#1567): every producer, reader, test and doc takes them from here, so a change is made
 *  in one place. Each shape has one producer: `sessionEnd` lib/session-end.mjs `sessionEndOf`; the
 *  start's `resume` object lib/core.mjs `resumeAnswer`; the sweep's rows lib/session-resume.mjs
 *  (`rowFromStart`, `predicted` and the rows it answers without a start). Dependency-free. */
