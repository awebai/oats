/** The pi bridge (`@awebai/oats-pi`) in every pi folder a launch of a deployment uses: which
 *  folders those are, the bridge found in each, and what `oats update` does there
 *  (awebai/oats#991, #852). `oats doctor` warns from the same list.
 *
 *  This module only reads: the environment it is given, the launch configurations it is given
 *  and each folder's bridge `package.json`. Nothing here runs `pi` or `npm`; `oats update`
 *  (bin/oats.mjs) runs the steps the plan names.
 *
 *  A pi folder of the deployment is the default (`~/.pi/agent`), this process's own
 *  `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, and the `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` of each launch configuration whose
 *  harness is pi: "the ambient one and each launch configuration's", as `trustTargets`
 *  (harness-trust-write.mjs) lists the claude and codex configuration files. Homes' recorded
 *  launches are not read: a home keeps a launch its configuration no longer has, and the list
 *  would then depend on every home.
 *
 *  `oats update` moves forward only (awebai/oats#1011): the CLI to a newer version of the
 *  registry, a bridge to the version the kernel has after the run. Neither is ever moved back,
 *  and the registry's answer is checked to be one version before anything is made of it.
 *
 *  The move is one `pi install` over the installed bridge, never an uninstall first: pi
 *  replaces the settings entry and the files of the same package, and an install that fails
 *  leaves the old ones in place (established with pi 1.0.2). The folder's version is read
 *  back after each step, so a pi that behaves otherwise is a named failure, not a silent one. */
