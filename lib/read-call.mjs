/** lib/read-call.mjs — one call of a deployment read (awebai/oats#1630): the scope `oats status` and
 *  `oats workspace status` run in (lib/roster-read.mjs, lib/workspace-read.mjs), so that the CLI runs
 *  each once and a long-lived process answers them many times with the same code.
 *
 *  In a one-shot CLI, process exit is what forgets a read's state. A call does that itself: it starts
 *  by resetting every piece of module-level state its reads can reach (READ_STATE, which
 *  test/read-call-state.test.mjs pins against a scan of the reads' import closure), and ends by draining
 *  what its read session found worth telling the operator. A read answers `{ exit, answer, stderr }`:
 *  `answer` the JSON value the CLI prints, every refusal an answer too (refuse); `stderr` the read
 *  session's notices, as the CLI says them. Each read has a data layer beside it (`…View`): `view`, what
 *  bin's text renderer reads, in place of `answer`, without the JSON-only work.
 *
 *  The context: `dir` (absolute), `maxAge` (null, or the --max-age seconds: parseMaxAge), `session` (a
 *  function answering the caller's read session, created by callSession: the CLI's is created at its
 *  first remote read and carries the CLI's exit and signal listeners; a reader's is created at the start
 *  of the request), `cacheDir` (the remote cache, absolute, or none), and `deployments` (an observer of
 *  the deployment the call resolves, settled when the call ends; the CLI passes none and settles its own
 *  at exit, lib/resolved-deployment.mjs). A call registers no process listener and closes no session:
 *  the caller closes it. Nor does it read argv or the working directory: the caller owns the process's
 *  cwd, which still reaches the children the reads run by name (tmux, git: a relative or empty PATH entry
 *  is resolved against it), so a caller answering for a deployment runs the call with that deployment
 *  as its cwd, as the CLI does when run there. Kernel-private, not exported from `./core`. Dependency-free.
