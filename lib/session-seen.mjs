/** What the kernel has seen of each launched home's session (feature session-resume, #1559;
 *  awebai/oats#1567 item 3): the record the sweep reads so that it resumes only a loss it can vouch
 *  for. Kernel-private, not a contract, under OATS_HOME_DIR beside the per-boot note: one file per
 *  deployment, `session-resume/seen/<first 16 hex of sha256(instances root)>.json`,
 *    { deployment, root, homes: { <home's real path>: { startId, lastSeenRunningAt, lastSeenRunningBoot,
 *      firstNotRunningAt, firstNotRunningBoot, judgedBy } } }
 *  (times ISO; boots bootId's, null without one; `judgedBy` `{ at, boot, outcome }` or null).
 *
 *  - Observations have one producer, a local `listInstances` (`oats status`, the sweep's own read
 *    and every other local listing): recordSeen. A status routed to another machine reads nothing
 *    here; a start writes nothing.
 *  - `judgedBy` has one writer, a sweep that is not a plan (judgeLosses), once its rows are known:
 *    a status read never uses up a loss.
 *  - Never in the way of what reads it: an unreadable file is an empty record (which resumes
 *    nothing), every write error is swallowed and nothing is printed. A write is one atomic rename
 *    of the whole file, made only when something changed; two writers race harmlessly (the last
 *    rename wins whole).
 *  - Whether a loss is resumed is one pure function, resumeEligible.
 *  Dependency-free. */
