/**
 * lib/capability-show.mjs — `oats capabilities show` (feature capability-show, capabilityShowApi 1): what one
 * catalog row of `oats capabilities` ships — its inject text and each skill's files — and one file's text on
 * request, read at the row's commit through the read path a spawn uses. Contract: docs/desktop-cli-api.md
 * "`oats capabilities show`".
 *
 * - A member row is read from its member repository at the row's commit, a package row at the LOCKED commit,
 *   after the lock check a spawn makes (lockedCapability: the package's capability list there is the lock's).
 *   The package's full-tree digest is not recomputed: `oats sync` proved the lock's integrity over the tree of
 *   exactly that commit, and the commit id content-addresses the tree.
 * - Skills are the spawn's enumeration (capabilitySkills over enumerateSkills, lib/resolve.mjs); a skill's
 *   files are every regular file under its directory (listRemoteFiles), at most FILES_PER_SKILL.
 * - Every read goes through lib/remote.mjs at a full commit id: nothing reads a working clone and nothing is
 *   written outside the remote cache.
 * - Paths in the answers are POSIX and relative to the capability directory. `--file` reads only a path the
 *   show lists (the inject, a listed skill file): no other file of the capability is readable through it.
 *
 * Every text is untrusted repository content; a consumer renders it as plain text or through a sanitising
 * renderer (the docs say so).
