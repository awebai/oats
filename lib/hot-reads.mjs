/** The CLI's hot reads (awebai/oats#1630): the reads the Desktop, the TUI and agents' hooks run over and
 *  over load only the modules they use, never core.mjs. `bin/oats.mjs` asks hotRead for its argv before
 *  its imports; for a hot read, each of its import lines (`lib/<name>.mjs`) takes the leaves listed here
 *  for that name, the modules its names are defined in and re-exported from (hotImport). Every specifier
 *  is one string literal, here and in bin, so that a reader of the sources (test/client-boundary.test.mjs)
 *  sees every module the CLI can load. Every other command, and a
 *  hot read given anything but the words and flags listed here (help, an unknown flag, a missing value),
 *  imports every module as before.
 *
 *  A list must hold every module the read's code can reach, its error paths included. A line a read
 *  does not list, or a name its leaves do not export, is a tripwire (standIn): taking it is free, and
 *  any use of it throws a HotReadUnlisted defect that names the read, the line and the name.
 *  test/cli-hot-reads.test.mjs runs each read and pins the modules it must not load. Kernel-private,
 *  not exported from `./core`. Dependency-free. */
