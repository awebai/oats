/** lib/reader.mjs — `oats reader --stdio`, the warm reader (awebai/oats#1630): a process a client starts as its own
 *  child, which answers `oats status --json` and `oats workspace status --json` over its stdin and stdout, many
 *  times, with the kernel's own read code (lib/roster-read.mjs and lib/workspace-read.mjs, through
 *  lib/read-call.mjs). The contract is docs/desktop-cli-api.md "The warm reader"; the decisions,
 *  docs/design/2026-10-29-warm-reader.md.
 *
 *  - Warm code, not warm data. Each request reads the deployment afresh: its answer is what `oats <argv>`, run by
 *    this install with the same environment and with cwd = `--dir`, prints and exits with. What the reader cannot
 *    answer that way it refuses, and the client runs the CLI.
 *  - One request at a time, in arrival order. The reads' module state is process-wide (lib/read-call.mjs
 *    READ_STATE), and so is the cwd: the children the reads run by name (tmux, git) resolve a relative PATH
 *    entry against it, so the reader chdirs to the request's `--dir` for the read and back to its install root
 *    when the request ends, never keeping a deployment directory that may go away. A second lane must first give
 *    each child its own cwd.
 *  - The install stamp (installStamp): an install that changed under the reader (an upgrade, a Node upgrade) is
 *    never answered from the old code. That request and every queued one are refused E_READER_STALE, and the
 *    reader exits 0.
 *  - Its lifetime is the client's: stdin EOF or error, EPIPE on stdout, SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP end it. A request in
 *    flight is not answered, and its read session is closed from the `exit` handler, which kills its git
 *    children (a deployments-list lock, lib/dir-lock.mjs, exits from its own signal handler).
 *  - Its stdout carries protocol lines only: anything else written there (console.log) goes to stderr, and every
 *    child on the read path pipes or ignores its stdout.
 *  Kernel-private, not exported from `./core`. Dependency-free. */
