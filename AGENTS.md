# Working in the OATS repository

This repository is the OATS kernel and CLI (`lib/`, `bin/oats.mjs`), the pi
adapter and the Desktop (`packages/`), the `oats.framework` package
(`oats-package/`), and the reference docs (`docs/`). The map is in
[docs/implementation.md](docs/implementation.md).

## Rules

- **The kernel stays runtime-neutral and dependency-free.** Nothing in `lib/`
  depends on a harness or a provider; provider behaviour belongs in a
  capability.
- **Contracts are breaking for every deployment.** A change to a config key,
  a manifest field, the hook environment, a JSON answer the Desktop reads or
  the lock format needs a maintainer decision first. Grep for consumers
  (`packages/pi`, `packages/desktop`, the capabilities) before changing an
  export or a JSON shape.
- **Never weaken trust or integrity checks** (package integrity, the lock,
  path containment) without an explicit decision.
- **Behaviour and docs change together.** An operator-visible change updates
  the reference page in `docs/` that owns the rule, and adds its release-notes
  entry as a file of its own under `docs/release-notes/next/`
  ([Release-notes entries](docs/release-lane.md#release-notes-entries)); it
  edits the version's notes file only to correct an entry there that it makes
  untrue.
- **Tests pin behaviour.** A behaviour change changes its test in the same
  commit. Never weaken an assertion to make a change pass.
- The package mirrors in `mirrors/` (`mirrors/oats-okf*` and the other
  official packages' capabilities) are generated from their own repositories;
  never edit them by hand. They stay out of `capabilities/`: member discovery
  would list them as this repository's own capabilities, beside their packages.
  `capabilities/` holds only this repository's own capabilities.

## Gates

**Pull-request CI is the test run. Never run the kernel's or the Desktop's
test suites locally,** on any host: not `npm test`, not the Desktop's suite,
not a shard, and not a batch of "every affected file". CI runs the full suite
(sharded), the Desktop's tests, `pack:check` and the clean-room smoke on every
pull request; the macOS workflow, started by hand at a branch's exact head,
covers the macOS paths. Push the branch and read its run.

Locally, run `npm run validate` and `npm run check` (they run no tests). Run
at most one or two test files, or a name-filtered run of one, to reproduce or
confirm a single finding, with `uptime` first. Name what you ran in your
hand-over, and link the CI run for everything else.
