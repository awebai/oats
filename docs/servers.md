# Servers: running instances on another machine

A **server** is another machine with its own OATS and deployment, reached
over OpenSSH. `--server <id>` runs a command on that machine's OATS with the
same flags and JSON envelope as a local call. The server's kernel does the
work ([execution-targets.md](execution-targets.md)); this machine routes and
keeps a saved route per remote instance.

## Register

```bash
oats server add build --ssh build-host --workspace /srv/team --oats /usr/local/bin/oats
oats server check build      # ssh reachability, remote version, workspace roster and Git readability
oats server list [--workspace-ref <ref>]
oats server remove build
```

To put a workspace on a machine that has no deployment yet, use
[`oats server connect`](#connect-a-machine) instead of `server add`.

- `--ssh` is an OpenSSH host alias or host name, never `user@host` or an
  option. Users, keys and host verification belong in `~/.ssh/config`.
  Connections are non-interactive (`BatchMode=yes`): a prompt fails fast.
- `--workspace` is the absolute path of the deployment directory on the
  server: the directory that holds its `oats-local.yaml`
  ([configuration.md](configuration.md)). Routed commands run there as
  `--dir <workspace>`.
- `--oats` is the remote executable (default: `oats` on the remote PATH).
- `--path` prepends directories to the minimal remote PATH of every routed
  command (`~/.local/bin:/opt/pi/bin`), where the remote spawn looks for the
  harness binary.
- `--herdr` is refused (`E_HERDR_REMOVED`): Herdr was removed in 0.31.0. A
  registration or saved route that still records `herdrPath` loads; the field
  is ignored, never written or printed.
- `--label` sets a display name. `--replace` overwrites an existing id.
- Registrations live in `~/.oats/servers.json` on this machine, never in a
  repository. Every change to the file (add, remove, a learned workspace key,
  connect) is a short read-modify-write of the file as it is then, under the
  lock directory `~/.oats/servers.lock`, so concurrent commands never lose each
  other's registrations. A lock still held after 5 s, or left by a process
  that died, is refused with `E_SERVERS_BUSY`, naming the directory to remove
  once no oats process is changing the registry.

**Which workspace a server serves.** A registration records `workspaceKey`:
the canonical key of the workspace its host deployment realizes, as the
host's own `oats status --json` reports it (`workspace.key`). It is learned,
never typed:

- `server add` asks the host after writing the registration. A host that does
  not answer one (unreachable, no deployment at `--workspace`, a kernel before
  0.38) is registered without it, with a warning.
- `server check` records it when the registration has none, and `server
  connect` writes it.
- A key is recorded only on the registration that was asked: if the
  registration is removed or pointed elsewhere while the host is being asked,
  the answer is dropped (`server add` warns), never written onto the new
  entry or used to bring a removed one back.
- A host reporting a different key than the recorded one is
  `E_SERVER_WORKSPACE_MISMATCH` (`details: {recorded, reported}`) and the
  registration is not rewritten. If the host now serves another workspace,
  register it again with `server add <id> --replace`.
- `server list --workspace-ref <ref>` lists the servers whose key is the
  canonical key of `<ref>` (any spelling of the same repository matches), and
  `unknownWorkspace` names the ids whose key is not known yet. One host can
  carry several registrations, one per deployment.

`server check` also asks the host whether its Git reads the workspace remote
(`workspaceReadable`; the host's [`onboard --check`](#what-connect-runs-on-the-host)),
which is where a [macOS keychain](#git-on-a-macos-host) problem shows up.

## Connect a machine

```bash
oats server connect altair-aweb --ssh altair --path /opt/homebrew/bin --install-oats
```

Run from a deployment, `server connect` puts that deployment's workspace on
the machine behind `--ssh` and registers it, from a host with nothing but
ssh access and Node.js. Every run re-checks every step and does only what is
missing, so after a human step you run the same command again.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `--workspace-ref <ref>` | this deployment's `oats-local.yaml` `workspace:` |
| `--dir <path>` | `~/Agents/<this deployment's directory name>`; absolute or `~/…`, resolved by the host |
| `--oats <path>`, `--path <dirs>`, `--label <text>` | as for `server add`; `--path` is where the host finds `npm`, `oats` and the harnesses |
| `--install-oats` | off: a missing or older OATS is a human step |
| `--replace` | off: an id registered for another host or directory is refused |

The steps, in order:

| Step | Checks | When something is missing |
|---|---|---|
| `ssh` | the host answers a non-interactive ssh | `failed` `E_SSH` |
| `oats` | `oats version --json` there is this kernel's version or newer and advertises `server-connect` (a build of the same version without it is not enough) | with `--install-oats`: runs `npm install -g @awebai/oats@<this version>` there (`done`); without it, or with no `npm` on the host's PATH: `needs-human` with the command to run |
| `git` | the host's Git reads the workspace remote | `needs-human` with the remedy (and the [keychain hint](#git-on-a-macos-host)) |
| `deployment` | `--dir` holds a deployment of this workspace | an absent or empty directory is onboarded there (`done`); a deployment of another workspace is `failed` `E_SERVER_WORKSPACE_MISMATCH`; a non-empty directory without `oats-local.yaml` is `failed` `E_DIR_NOT_EMPTY` and nothing is written into it |
| `register` | the registration exists, with its `workspaceKey` | written (`done`); an id registered for another target is `failed` `E_SERVER_EXISTS` unless `--replace` (checked before anything else, so a requested id never reports ready while it routes elsewhere); a new id whose host and directory are already registered under another id is reported (`ok`, naming that id; the text result then names that id to spawn with) and not registered twice |
| `readiness` | each soul of the host deployment (disabled souls skipped) passes `oats readiness` there | each failing or unknown required item becomes a `needs-human` line, once for all the souls that share it; the listing and the checks share one 60 s budget, and souls it does not reach (a check it cuts off included) become one line naming the command to check them; a broken link still fails the run (`E_SSH`) |

A step is `ok` (already so), `done` (this run did it), `needs-human` (its
`remedy` says what to run where; later steps are `skipped`, waiting for it)
or `failed` (the run ends). The result is `ready` when no step needs a
human. Connect never handles credentials: what Git on the host cannot read
is always a human step there. The `--json` shape is in
[desktop-cli-api.md](desktop-cli-api.md#oats-server-connect).

### What connect runs on the host

Besides `version --json`, `status --json`, `souls --json` and `readiness
--json`, connect runs two commands there:

- `oats onboard <dir> --workspace <ref> --check --json`, read-only: where
  `<dir>` is (a leading `~` is the host's home), whether it is absent, empty,
  not empty, not a directory or a deployment, and whether the host's Git
  reads the workspace remote. An unreadable remote is part of the answer
  (`remote.readable: false` with the error), not a failure. Without
  `--workspace`, a deployment's own workspace is read.
- `oats onboard <dir> --workspace <ref> --json`, only when the directory is
  absent or empty. This is the only way connect onboards on a host; `onboard`
  itself is not routed with `--server`.

### Git on a macOS host

Git on macOS usually keeps the forge token in the login keychain, through
its credential helper. A session without a terminal (an ssh command, which is
how every routed command runs, or a background job) cannot open that
keychain, so reading a private remote fails as `auth` even though the same
command works in a terminal on that Mac.

When a remote read fails as `auth` on macOS in a session with no terminal on
stdin or with `SSH_CONNECTION` set, `E_REMOTE_UNREADABLE` carries
`details.hint: "keychain-non-interactive"` and `details.remedy`, and the
message names the two ways out, run once on that Mac:

```bash
gh auth login --insecure-storage   # keep the token in gh's own file, not the keychain
gh auth setup-git                  # let Git use gh's token
```

or read the remote with an SSH key the session can reach. A key with a
passphrase fails in the same sessions for the same reason: an ssh session has
no `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` of its own, so it cannot reach the desktop login's
ssh-agent. Use a key without a passphrase, or point `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` at the
login agent in the shell's startup file (for zsh, `~/.zshenv`, which
non-interactive sessions read). OATS never reads or changes credentials
itself; the hint is about where Git ran, not a probe of the keychain.

## Connections

Every routed ssh call carries these options, before `--` and the host:

| Option | Why |
|---|---|
| `BatchMode=yes`, `ConnectTimeout=15` | a prompt or an unreachable host fails fast |
| `ServerAliveInterval=15`, `ServerAliveCountMax=3` | a link that died without a reset ends the call, an attached viewer included, within about 60 s |
| `ControlMaster=auto`, `ControlPath=~/.oats/ssh/%C`, `ControlPersist=60` | every call to one host (the probe, the command, a viewer, concurrent Desktop reads) shares one authenticated connection, kept 60 s after its last client |

- Options given with `-o` override `~/.ssh/config`, so these replace any
  `ControlMaster`, `ControlPath` or `ControlPersist` set there for the host.
  Everything else in your ssh config (users, keys, `ProxyJump`, host
  verification) applies as usual; a `ProxyJump` host is reached once per
  master.
- `~/.oats/ssh` (under `OATS_HOME_DIR` when set) is created mode 0700. OATS
  does not use it if it is owned by another user or writable by group or
  others.
- ssh binds the control socket at the path plus 17 bytes, within the 104-byte
  socket path limit of macOS, so the directory path may be at most 45 bytes.
  `/Users/<name>/.oats/ssh` fits for any name up to 23 characters. The path
  must also be one ssh reads literally: letters, digits and `. _ / + , : @ =
  -` only (a space, `%`, `$`, a quote or `#` is ssh syntax).
- When the path does not fit, has other characters, or the directory is not
  private, calls run with `ControlPath=none` instead: no connection sharing,
  including any your ssh config sets up; keepalives still apply. The command
  warns once per server on stderr, naming the path and the fix (an
  `OATS_HOME_DIR` or `HOME` that is shorter or plain).
- A master left stale by a network drop is replaced by ssh on the next call.
- The version probe (`oats version --json`) is asked once per process per
  server and target. `server add --replace` to another target forgets it.
- When ssh fails under an attached viewer (a lost link, or one never made),
  `session attach --server` exits 255 and says that, if the link was lost,
  the instance keeps running on the server, with the command to reattach.
  When ssh fails before the viewer opens (the version probe, or a name
  resolved through the host's roster), it also exits 255, with `oats: ssh to
  <host> failed: …` (`--json`: the `E_SSH` envelope). Every other refusal
  (an incompatible host, an unknown or ambiguous name, bad arguments) exits 1,
  and so does an ssh that cannot be run on this machine at all: no link can
  come back.
- Every routed command reports ssh's own failure as `E_SSH` (`ssh to <host>
  failed: …`). When ssh never started on this machine, the `--json` envelope
  says so with `error.details: {"sshStarted": false}`; without details, ssh
  ran and the link failed
  ([desktop-cli-api.md](desktop-cli-api.md#ssh-failures-e_ssh)).

## Run there

```bash
oats spawn dev --server build --purpose fix-123 --task-file task.md
oats status --server build
oats session attach --server build --instance dev-fix-123
oats retire dev-fix-123 --server build
```

Arguments are quoted for the remote shell. Local files (`--task-file`,
`--wake-file`, a schedule or launch-configuration `--file`) are read here and
sent as text or on stdin, never as paths.

| Command | Where it runs | The server must advertise |
|---|---|---|
| `spawn` | registered workspace | the requested harness, backend and yolo option; `launch-config` for `--launch-config`; `schedule` for a wake schedule |
| `status` | registered workspace | |
| `retire` | the instance's home | `retire-home` to retire by exact home |
| `session inspect`, `session attach` | the instance's home | `session` |
| `session start`, `session restart` | the instance's home | `session-start`; `session-restart`; `launch-config` when `--launch-config`, `--harness` or `--yolo` is given |
| `session upload` | the instance's home | `session-upload` |
| `okf harvest --instance <name>` | the saved home | `harvest` |
| `schedule ...` | registered workspace | `schedule` |
| `launch-config list\|set\|remove\|preview` | `--dir`, the instance's home, or the registered workspace | `launch-config` |
| `inspect`, `operation run` | `--dir`, the instance's home, or the registered workspace | `operations` |
| `readiness` | the instance's home, `--dir`, or the registered workspace | `readiness` (`readinessApi: 2`) |
| `instance events` | the instance's home | `instance-events-2` (`eventsApi: 2`) |
| `instance git`, `instance diff` | the instance's home; the Git runs there | `instance-git` (`instanceGitApi: 1`) |
| `instance stop --plan\|--apply`, `retire --plan`, `retire --plan-revision … --idempotency-key …` | the instance's home | `lifecycle-plans` (`lifecycleApi: 1`) |

Before every routed command except `status`, the kernel reads the server's
`oats version --json`. A remote OATS older than 0.22.1 is refused, and so is a
missing feature (`E_REMOTE_INCOMPATIBLE`), before anything is sent. A spawn is
checked against the harness it would use (the flag, or the soul's default as
the remote roster reports it). A host that advertises no harness list is
assumed to run only pi and claude, on tmux, with no launch options.

**Addressing an instance.** Instance commands (`retire`, the `session`
commands, `inspect`, `operation`, `launch-config`) reach any instance on the
server, whoever spawned it, by `--home </remote/home>` or by name
(`--instance <name>`, or the positional name of `retire`):

- A name spawned from this machine resolves through its saved route.
- Any other name resolves through the server's roster (one `status --json`
  in the registered workspace) to its one home. A name that two homes carry
  there is `E_AMBIGUOUS`, listing the homes (`error.details.candidates`);
  pass `--home`. A name the roster does not list is `E_SNAPSHOT_UNKNOWN`.
- A `--home` no saved route owns is sent through the registration's target;
  the server's kernel decides whether it is an instance home and its refusal
  is relayed as is.
- The home is the identity; use it when two souls on the host own
  same-named instances. A name and a home that disagree are refused
  (`E_HOME_MISMATCH`).

**`--dir` with `--server`.** For `inspect`, `operation`, `launch-config`,
`readiness`, `instance`, and a `retire --plan` or guarded retire apply, an
explicit `--dir` names a directory on the server and travels as is. Every
other routed command refuses `--dir`; its scope comes from the
registration.

**Capability commands.** Any capability command routes with `--server`:

```bash
oats aweb setup --join aweb --invite-stdin --soul dev --server altair-aweb < invite.txt
```

The host runs the same argv, minus `--server <id>` (or `--server=<id>`;
after a `--` the argv is the provider's and is never read), as `oats <namespace>
<command> …` from the registered workspace directory: the kernel's
capability dispatch finds the deployment from its working directory, so no
`--dir` is added to the provider's argv. `--soul` and every other flag go
through untouched. Stdin is forwarded as is and never read or logged here;
when stdin is a terminal nothing is forwarded and the host's stdin is
closed. The host's stdout, stderr and exit status are relayed; with
`--json` its envelope is relayed verbatim, and when nothing comes back this
side answers one envelope (`E_SSH`, or `E_REMOTE_ENVELOPE`). Wherever this
side prints the argv, `--invite` values are replaced by `<redacted>`.
Kernel commands keep the table above.

**Not routed.** `session input` runs on the execution host, where schedules
and messaging capabilities call it. `session restart --stop-grace` is refused
with `--server`; the remote default applies. `session attach --print` shows
the ssh command without running it. A server without the `session` commands
(before 0.22.2) is refused with the tmux command to attach there directly,
naming the session and window its roster records for the instance (else
`pi-agents`, that kernel's default).

## The roster and harvest

```bash
oats server roster --json                                # one group per server and target
oats okf harvest --server build --instance dev-fix-123   # the harvest, run in the saved home
```

The **roster** is what the Desktop shows: one group per server id and route
target (host and workspace), with the registration (present or not), the
probe result, the host's workspace identity (`workspace`: its own `status
--json` `workspace` object relayed verbatim, reachability only from a host
before 0.36.0, `null` when it reports none or the probe failed), the remote souls, the instances joined with saved routes
(`savedRoute`, `running` or `null` when unknown, `retirePending`,
`rollbackIncomplete`, `missingRemotely`, `addressable`), and `retireFailures`
(deferred self-retirements that failed there). Each instance row also relays
the host's own facts from its `status --json`: `identity`,
`identityAddress`, `teams`, `startedAt`, `createdAt`, `model`,
`runtimeState`, `parentInstance`, `siblingInstance`, `relation`,
`relativeTo` and `spawnOrigin`. A fact the host does not supply is `null`
(an older host, or a saved route the host no longer lists). A row also
carries `waitingOnYou` (needs input) when the host's kernel reports it, and
only then: an older host's row has no such key. A removed or edited registration keeps
its group from the saved routes. State is pulled on every call within
`--per-target` (default 20 s) of a total `--budget` (default 45 s); a group
not reached is reported with `E_ROSTER_BUDGET`. `--server <id>` narrows it.

**Harvest** runs the knowledge capability's `okf harvest --json` in the
instance's saved home on the server and relays its envelope.

## What this machine keeps

A **saved route** per remote instance, under `~/.oats/remote/<server>/`,
written at spawn: the ssh host, workspace, oats path and PATH prefix, and the
remote home. Retire, harvest and session commands use
the saved route, not the current registration, so editing or removing a
registration never orphans a remote home. The route is removed when the
remote kernel reports the home gone.

- `oats server add --replace` to a different host or workspace, while saved
  routes still point at the old one, makes the next `spawn --server` fail with
  `E_ROUTE_CHANGED`. Register the new target under a new id, or retire the old
  instances first.
- A saved route is never pointed at a different home. A spawn whose name already
  has a route under that server leaves the new instance without one
  (`routeConflict` in the result, with a warning naming the host-side retire).
- A saved route whose instance is gone on the host (`missingRemotely`) cannot
  be retired. Drop it with `oats server forget <id> --instance <name>`.
- `retire --server` sends the saved home as `--home`, so a same-named
  instance under another soul is never the one retired.

## Limits

- No Git runs over SSH: repository operations always run on the server, by
  its kernel, in its deployment.
