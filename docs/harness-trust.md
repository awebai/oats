# Explicit native harness trust

Run this command on the host where Claude or Codex runs, while other native
configuration editors are quiescent:

```sh
oats harness trust --dir /absolute/deployment --harness all --plan
oats harness trust --dir /absolute/deployment --harness all
```

`--plan` reads only. The bare command applies a fresh plan; there is no `--apply`.
The default harness is `all`, in Claude-then-Codex order. `claude` or `codex`
selects one. The deployment is resolved from the existing local command context,
including when invoked from an instance home, then canonicalized with the native
filesystem lookup. The result, native key, audit and reader verification use that
on-disk spelling, including on case-insensitive APFS. No remote
adapter, arbitrary file selector, parent-root substitution or harness launch is
performed. A native executable need not be installed to edit the qualified format.

The command writes only the canonical deployment root's native trust leaf:

- Claude: `projects[root].hasTrustDialogAccepted = true` in
  `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json`, or `~/.claude.json`.
- Codex: `projects[root].trust_level = "trusted"` in
  `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`, or `~/.codex/config.toml`.

It writes that leaf into every configuration file a launch of the deployment
reads. The targets of each selected harness are:

- the ambient file: the one a launch of this deployment with no launch
  configuration reads. It is read as every check of a launch reads it
  ([the checks read the pane](execution-targets.md#the-checks-read-the-pane)):
  the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `CODEX_HOME` of the deployment's tmux
  session, else of the OATS tmux server, else the default above under that
  session's or server's `HOME`. It is not the operator's own shell's when
  the server holds another account;
- one file for each launch configuration (`launch-configs:` in the
  deployment's `oats-local.yaml`, or in this machine's
  [`~/.oats/config/launch-configs.yaml`](configuration.md#this-machines-launch-configurations))
  of that harness whose `env` sets
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (claude) or `CODEX_HOME` (codex), as a literal or a
  `{fromEnv: NAME}` reference resolved from the environment the command runs
  in;
- one file for each launch configuration of that harness whose `env` sets
  `HOME` and not that variable, when its launch has no such variable at
  all (the session and the server set none either): the default file above
  under that `HOME`, which is the file its launch reads. When the session
  or the server sets the variable, that launch reads the ambient file, and
  the configuration has no file of its own.

Targets with the same canonical directory are one file. Each plan entry says
whether it is the ambient file (`ambient`) and which launch configurations
use it (`launchConfigs`). A launch configuration whose reference is not set,
whose path is not absolute or selects no usable directory, or whose directory does not exist is a named
`problem` on its entry, for a `HOME` as for the harness's own variable. OATS never creates a harness configuration directory:
create it, or start the harness with it once, then rerun. A missing ambient
directory (`~/.codex` for a user who has never run Codex, for example) means
the harness has not run as this user: with `--harness all` that harness's
entry is `skipped`, with its `reason`, and the other harness proceeds; naming
that harness (`--harness codex`) makes it a problem. Any problem refuses the
whole plan before a write, as an unsupported file does.
Each file is verified through the reader under the environment that selects
it.

The plan shows what will be written before anything is. `warnings` says
what selects the ambient file when a selector does (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
selects <dir> (the global CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR of the OATS tmux server
(<socket>)); effective file <file>`). Four cases have no pane to read:

- **No OATS tmux server runs.** The command does not start one, and does not
  start your login shell to find out what one would hold. The ambient file
  is then the operator's own, and `warnings` says so: `claude: the pane's
  environment is not established until a spawn starts the OATS tmux server
  (none runs); read instead: this process's CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (not set),
  this process's HOME`.
- **The command has no tmux on its `PATH`.** It makes no read, and no
  prediction: the ambient file is the operator's own, as with no server, and
  `warnings` says so: `claude: the pane's environment is not established:
  this process has no tmux on its PATH to read the OATS tmux server with;
  read instead: …`. If a server does run on this host, run the command with
  a `PATH` that holds tmux, so that it writes for the file launches read.
- **tmux could not say whether the server runs.** `tmux -L oats
  list-sessions` was refused or cut off. That is a read that failed, not
  "no server runs": one may run, under another account. The ambient target is `refused`, nothing is written, to
  any file, and the command answers `E_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT_UNKNOWN` with what
  failed: `… could not read the OATS tmux server for session <name>:
  <failure>. What has to answer, as this process: \`tmux -L oats
  list-sessions\`. A server that could not be asked may run under another
  account than this process's, so this process's file is not written in its
  place`. Run the command where that tmux command answers.
- **A server runs and its environment cannot be read** (the read fails, or
  the value holds a `$`, a line break or a character tmux prints encoded;
  `HOME` cleared or missing when there is no selector). The ambient target
  is `refused` with a `problem` that names which name, where it was read
  and what would make it readable, and nothing is written, to any file: the
  command answers `E_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT_UNKNOWN`. It never writes to a file
  guessed from the operator's shell. When a launch configuration's target is
  refused as well, the code is `E_CONFIG_BROKEN`, as for that target alone,
  and the details hold both.

Nonempty override directories must be absolute. Directory aliases are resolved;
symlink/nonregular/hardlinked leaves, foreign ownership and ACLs refuse. On Linux, GNU ls's single `.` security-context marker is accepted;
the context must be readable, match the same-directory candidate before replacement,
and remain unchanged at verification. A differing directory-default context refuses
before rename; OATS does not relabel files. This comparison narrows metadata races,
not the documented uncooperative-writer race. Tests simulate these SELinux probes;
they are not a live SELinux-host qualification.

On macOS, any extended-attribute (`@`) or ACL (`+`) marker deliberately refuses,
including `com.apple.provenance`. This v1 writer does not copy or remove those
attributes. See [When the writer refuses](#when-the-writer-refuses); a refusal
never authorizes stripping its metadata automatically. Existing file permissions are preserved.
No configuration directory is ever created; a new file uses 0600. The plan shows the effective file,
semantic key, current/desired trust scalar, byte digests and override provenance;
it never returns other config values or credentials.

This explicit act is the exception to read-only launch trust checks. Spawning,
scaffolding, starting and retiring do not write native trust or create consent
records. Existing Codex root-trust/yolo per-invocation overrides are unchanged.
This command does not enable development-channel prompt consent, change permission
mode, authenticate, install a plugin, or establish model/channel readiness.

## When the writer refuses

The writer refuses a configuration file it cannot replace exactly as it found
it, and then writes nothing at all. The refused entry's `problem` names the
file and the check that refused it, in fixed wording; it never repeats the
file's content or a parser message:

| `problem` says the file | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| is not a regular file (a symbolic link, directory or other type) | The path is a link, a directory or another type; only a plain file is replaced. |
| has more than one hard link | Replacing it would split it from its other names. |
| is owned by another user | Only a file the current user owns is replaced. |
| has setuid, setgid or sticky bits set | Special mode bits are not carried across a replacement. |
| has an extended-attribute (@) or ACL (+) marker in ls ... | macOS extended attributes (such as `com.apple.provenance`) or an ACL, or an ACL on Linux: this writer neither copies nor removes them. The `problem` also gives the way forward, below. |
| has a Linux security context that cannot be read | `ls -Z` gave no usable context for a file whose `ls` mode shows one. |
| its metadata could not be read (the ls probe failed or its answer is not recognized) | `ls` failed, or printed a mode this writer does not recognize. |
| changed while it was being read | Another writer replaced it during the read; rerun. |
| is not in a usable configuration directory (a path that is not a directory, or one with no existing ancestor) | The directory that should hold the file is not a directory. Target resolution normally reports this first, as the named problem below. |
| is larger than 8 MiB | The file is over the size the writer reads. |
| is not valid UTF-8 | The bytes do not decode losslessly. |
| is not in the supported format (see "Qualified scope and formats" in docs/harness-trust.md) | The editor or the trust reader does not support its shape; see [Qualified scope and formats](#qualified-scope-and-formats). |
| could not be read (`<errno code>`) | Any other read error, by its code alone (for example `EACCES`). |

When the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` or `HOME` that selects the ambient
file (read as described above) is not an absolute path, or selects no usable
directory, the ambient entry's `problem` names that variable and where it was
read, never its value: `the file a claude launch with no launch configuration
reads could not be established: <where> is not an absolute path`.
Launch-configuration, missing-directory and unreadable-environment problems
are described above.

**The macOS marker.** On macOS, a configuration file that Claude rewrites can
carry `com.apple.provenance`, and the writer refuses it. Do not edit the file or
its attributes. Instead, start a Claude session with the configuration
directory the launch uses (the same `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, or none for
`~/.claude.json`), in the deployment folder, and accept Claude's own
folder-trust dialog there. The `harness-trust` item of `oats readiness` is the
check that this is met: it reads the file without the writer's metadata
checks. Until it passes, spawns in that deployment warn with the line shown in
[Launch-time checks and readiness](#launch-time-checks-and-readiness). The
same applies to an ACL marker on Linux, and to Codex with its own trust prompt
and `CODEX_HOME`.

**A refusal does not block the rest of an upgrade.** Only
`oats harness trust` runs the writer. `oats sync`, `oats readiness` and
`oats doctor` never call it and start no session; the `harness-trust` item of
readiness is never required, so a missing trust does not make the deployment
not ready.

## Qualified scope and formats

Claude 2.1.289 darwin-arm64 was qualified against pinned native source and a
private no-Git deployment. One native root acceptance preceded two fresh child
launches. Root trust was true before each; neither child had accepted trust;
both reached ordinary UI. Native child bookkeeping later contained false.
Both bypass-mode controls in a separate disposable deployment still asked trust.
Native source independently walks trusted ancestors outside repository boundaries.
The recorded recipe and source exclude channel argv as a grant of trust. There
was no contemporaneous per-process environment snapshot; the same-runner root
trust question and absence of child recipe/capability bypass settings support
this bounded evidence. This is not qualification of other versions, nested Git
layouts or account/channel readiness.

Codex 0.160.1 native source independently declares a project `trust_level` and
writes `trusted`/`untrusted` under the project path. See the pinned
[native writer](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.160.1/codex-rs/core/src/config/mod.rs)
and [configuration type](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.160.1/codex-rs/config/src/config_toml.rs).
OATS's existing root-consent-to-exact-home invocation override remains separate
from native ancestor inheritance; Claude evidence is not Codex evidence.

JSON parsing rejects duplicate keys and wrong shapes. Only the required missing
object suffix or existing boolean token changes; unrelated large numbers, keys,
spacing and newlines remain byte-identical. False becomes true; an existing true
is a byte/mtime-preserving no-op.

The dependency-free TOML editor supports ordinary single-line assignments,
quoted/bare/dotted keys, explicit project tables, dotted trust keys and the
reader's inline project form containing only `trust_level`. It validates scalar,
single-line array and inline-table structure, duplicate/conflicting definitions,
and signed 64-bit integers. Multiline values, array-of-table headers, dates,
nondecimal numbers and unsupported representations refuse even if another TOML
parser accepts them. Root-level inline `projects` and inline project entries with
additional fields refuse rather than write a shape the existing readiness reader
does not consume. Comments, whitespace and line endings outside edit spans stay
unchanged. Untrusted becomes trusted; other trust values/types refuse. Both
editors validate the candidate and compare semantic trees with only the intended
leaf changed. Unsupported native format changes require refreshed qualification.

A Claude root entry cannot cover a home behind an intervening Git boundary.
Readiness may still warn after an unchanged root apply. Inspect that boundary;
do not automatically write a second root or answer a trust dialog.

## Launch-time checks and readiness

Spawn, `session start|restart`, `launch-config preview` and `oats readiness`
read folder trust from the file the launch's own environment selects: the
launch configuration's `env`, else the environment the launch's tmux pane
will have, never the calling process's in its place
([the checks read the pane](execution-targets.md#the-checks-read-the-pane)).
Codex's per-invocation home trust follows the same file. They never write
it.

Readiness reports one `harness-trust` item (in `checks.configured`, never
required) for the launch a home recorded, or for the launch a soul selects.
It passes, naming the file, when that file trusts the deployment root or an
ancestor (for Claude, up to a Git boundary; a yolo Codex launch always
passes). Otherwise it warns, and the spawn warns with the same text, which
names where the launch gets the file from:

```text
<harness> folder trust is not established in <file> (<where from>): oats harness trust --dir <deployment>
```

`<where from>` is, for example, `the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR of launch
configuration work`, `the CODEX_HOME of tmux session agents` or `under the
global HOME of the OATS tmux server (<socket>)`. Two more answers:

- **The pane's environment could not be read** (a spawn or a start, and
  readiness with a server running): `<harness> folder trust: the
  configuration file this launch will read could not be established (<why,
  and what would make it readable>); nothing is said about its trust`. The
  readiness item is `unknown`, with `file` null.
- **No pane to read** (readiness with no server running, a spawn with
  `--no-launch`): the file read is the calling process's, and `<where
  from>` says so (`the pane's environment is not established until a spawn
  starts the OATS tmux server (none runs); read instead: this process's
  CODEX_HOME (not set), this process's HOME`). The readiness item is then
  `unknown` whether or not that file establishes trust; a spawn with
  `--no-launch` warns only when it does not.

A missing root entry does not prove that the harness will prompt (a native
gate can skip the question), so neither says the session will stop. A launch
configuration whose reference is not set on this host is named instead of a
file. OATS never answers a folder-trust prompt, and launch consent authorizes
no trust write.

## Durability, audit and recovery

All selected configs are preflighted before any native write. Cooperating OATS
writers acquire exclusive destination locks in canonical-path order plus an audit
lock. Existing locks refuse promptly. The human/JSON error message names the exact
lock path so an operator can inspect an interrupted apply; OATS never steals or
deletes another invocation's lock, even when it appears stale. Identity and
raw-byte digests are rechecked after locking and immediately before replacement.
Candidate files are exclusively created beside the destination, fsynced, atomically
renamed and verified through the existing trust reader. Native writers do not
honor OATS locks: final checks detect observed drift but cannot guarantee exclusion
against an uncooperative writer racing the rename. No native process is stopped.

The deployment-private `.agents/harness-trust.jsonl` is independent of instance
lifetime, alongside other private kernel events. Its new directory/file modes are
0700/0600. A checked, durable intent precedes each changed file; a checked outcome
follows it. An unchanged apply records an outcome without touching config bytes
or mtime. Plan creates no audit, directory, lock or temporary file. Invalid or
truncated existing JSONL refuses until operator inspection.

`all` is not a transaction. Failure stops later work, retains earlier changes and
reports unattempted entries; the error message names the failed files. Trust may already have been consumed, so no rollback
is simulated. Inspect the native files and audit before rerunning; a correct
existing entry converges as a no-op. `E_HARNESS_TRUST_INCOMPLETE` has closed reasons
`locked|changed|audit|write|verify` and a conservative `mayHaveChanged` flag.
An audit failure before a write prevents it; failure after a possible replacement
reports incomplete and preserves intent evidence. The command never claims that
failure means native trust was undone.

### Native qualification references

Claude source qualification used executable SHA256
`03d66745e3bb69ec727d66023696f3820bc0a00a8a5ba725eb6706d0c67cbe69`.
Its native exact/ancestor lookup is in byte range 182226330–182227750;
the startup trust decision is 197759244–197759315. The lookup has no
permission-mode or channel-argument input. Environment gates remain a separate
limit: `CLAUDE_CODE_SANDBOXED`, `IS_DEMO`, `CLAUBBIT` and the native `Le(false)`
gate can bypass the question. The disposable observation did not record a
contemporaneous child-process environment snapshot. No proprietary source is
included here.

Codex qualification is source-derived from `rust-v0.160.1`, independently of the
Claude observation. `set_project_trust_level_inner` (core config lines 2343–2410)
writes the exact project key and trust scalar; `ProjectConfig` (config type
lines 603–615) consumes the enum. The
[loader](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.160.1/codex-rs/config/src/loader/mod.rs)
uses exact normalized project lookup keys (lines 1030–1082), preferring canonical
path spelling (1370–1398). This qualifies the native representation; OATS retains
its separately tested invocation override instead of claiming universal native
ancestor inheritance. The source files' SHA256 digests are:

| Upstream path | SHA256 |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-rs/core/src/config/mod.rs` | `854f5a6b184714740500b8d3eae2bb04cb88172efccf11d38a74f2f6189c0341` |
