# OATS TUI (preview)

`oats tui` is the OATS terminal client: one full-screen, keyboard-only program
for people who work in terminals and on machines with no display, such as a
build host reached over ssh. The [OATS Desktop](desktop.md) is the client for
people who want a window; `oats tui` is the same kind of client for a
terminal. It ships inside the `oats` package: there is nothing else to
install.

## It is a preview

`oats tui` is marked **preview**. That means:

- **This version draws the frame only.** It shows the frame, answers `?`
  (help) and `q` (quit), and reads nothing from the kernel yet. The views
  (instances, souls, capabilities) arrive in later releases.
- **Its screens and its configuration file may change without notice** while
  it is a preview. Its configuration file, `tui.json`, does not exist yet.
- **It leaves preview when three things hold:** the readers it shares with
  the Desktop are in their shared home (`packages/client/`), a person has
  used it for a working day, and both maintainers agree to drop the mark.

Every other `oats` word keeps its contract. Nothing gates on `oats tui`:
`oats version --json` lists no feature for it.

## Start it

```bash
oats tui            # in a terminal of 80x24 or more
oats tui --ascii    # rules and marks in ASCII, whatever the locale
oats tui --help     # the usage; needs no terminal
```

It needs a terminal on both stdin and stdout, and a `TERM` that is set and is
not `dumb`. It draws from 60×15 up; on a smaller terminal it shows one line
with the size found and the size needed, and draws the frame again as soon as
the terminal is large enough. It follows a resize.

`--ascii` and `--help` are the only arguments. `--dir` and `--server` are
refused in this version: it reads no deployment yet.

## Keys

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `?` | opens the help; `?` again closes it |
| `Esc` | closes the help |
| `q`, `Ctrl+C` | quits, with status 0 (a SIGINT from outside answers 130) |
| `Ctrl+Z` | suspends: the shell gets the terminal back as it was; `fg` returns and redraws |
| `Ctrl+L` | redraws the whole screen, and sets the terminal's modes again if something reset them |

The help screen is generated from the same table the program acts on, so it
always lists the keys that work. `Ctrl+\` does nothing. Pasted text is never
read as keys: a paste is dropped whole.

The mouse is never needed and never captured: your terminal's own selection
and scrolling keep working.

## What it changes in your terminal, and restores

This is the complete list. On start, in this order:

1. raw mode on the terminal (keys arrive unbuffered and unechoed);
2. the alternate screen (`CSI ?1049h`), so your scrollback is untouched;
3. the cursor hidden (`CSI ?25l`);
4. autowrap off (`CSI ?7l`);
5. bracketed paste on (`CSI ?2004h`).

On the way out, the reverse: bracketed paste off, autowrap on, the style
reset (`CSI 0m`), the cursor shown, the alternate screen left, raw mode off.

Two of these have a reason worth stating:

- **Autowrap is off** so that no row can wrap when your terminal and the
  TUI's width table disagree about how wide a character is (some emoji and
  some scripts). Each row is positioned on its own and erased to its end, so
  a disagreement stays inside its row.
- **Bracketed paste is on** so that the terminal marks pasted text as a
  paste, and the TUI can drop it instead of acting on it.

The terminal is restored after every way out that a process can handle:

| Way out | Exit status |
|---|---|
| `q` or `Ctrl+C` | 0 |
| an internal error (its message is printed after the alternate screen is left) | 1 |
| SIGINT | 130 |
| SIGTERM | 143 |
| SIGHUP, or the terminal going away | 129 |
| SIGQUIT | 131 |

A suspend (`Ctrl+Z`, or SIGTSTP from outside) restores the terminal in full
before the process stops, and sets the same modes again when it continues.
It stops the whole foreground process group, as a `Ctrl+Z` does for any
other program, so `oats tui` started through a wrapper (`sh -c`, `npx`)
suspends as one job.

`Ctrl+C` is the quit key: in raw mode the terminal sends it as a byte, not as
a signal, so it answers 0. A SIGINT sent from outside (`kill -INT`) answers
130. A script that wraps `oats tui` meets that difference.

**SIGKILL cannot be handled.** No process can restore a terminal after
SIGKILL: the terminal is left in the alternate screen with the cursor hidden
and autowrap off. Run `reset`. Inside tmux also run `tput rmcup`: measured
on tmux 3.7c, `reset` brought back the cursor and autowrap, and the pane
stayed in the alternate screen until `tput rmcup`. Nothing else is left in
tmux: `oats tui` creates no session, window, option or key binding.

## What it never does

- It switches on **no mouse reporting, no focus reporting, no keyboard
  protocol, no keypad or cursor-key mode and no synchronized output**.
- It writes **no window title, no clipboard sequence, no bell**, and no query
  that expects the terminal to reply.
- It uses **only your terminal's own sixteen colours** and bold, dim,
  underline and reverse: no 256-colour or RGB value and no background fill,
  so your theme stays the theme. With `NO_COLOR` set and not empty it uses no
  colour at all. Nothing is told by colour alone.
- It draws its rules and marks in UTF-8 when `LC_ALL`, else `LC_CTYPE`, else
  `LANG` names UTF-8, and in ASCII otherwise or with `--ascii`. No icon font,
  no emoji. When the locale is not UTF-8, a character outside ASCII in text
  it shows is drawn as `?`.
- It **never writes an escape byte to anything that is not a terminal**.
- It **never writes text it did not author straight to the terminal.** A
  terminal acts on what is written to it, so every string from a kernel
  answer, a repository, an agent or another machine passes one filter before
  it is drawn: text holding a control character or a secret shape is shown
  as `[withheld]`, and bidi controls, invisible characters and C1 controls
  are replaced. The screen accepts only text that went through that filter
  or the TUI's own words.
- It touches no tmux option, key binding, server or session, starts no
  daemon, opens no socket and writes no file.

## Errors

| Error | When | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `E_NO_TERMINAL` | stdin or stdout is not a terminal, or `TERM` is unset, empty or `dumb`. One line on stderr, nothing on stdout, exit 1 | run it in a terminal; `oats status` prints the instances once |
| `E_BAD_ARGS` | `oats tui --json`: it is interactive and has no JSON form. The usual failure envelope, exit 1 | `oats status --json` is the machine view |
| `E_BAD_ARGS` | any argument other than `--ascii` and `--help`. One line on stderr with the usage, exit 1 | `oats tui --help` |

`E_NO_TERMINAL` appears only in that stderr line, never in a JSON envelope.

## Where it has been run

The automated tests run the real `oats tui` in tmux (a pane is a real
terminal: keys and screen are bytes through a pty), on a private tmux server.
Other terminals and multiplexers are untested so far: that is a statement
about the tests, not a list of what is supported. If it misbehaves in yours,
that is a bug worth reporting, with the terminal's name and `TERM`.
