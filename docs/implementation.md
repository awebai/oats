# Implementation reference

The reference implementation publishes two npm packages:

- **`@oas-framework/oas`**: runtime-neutral kernel, universal `oas` CLI,
  bootstrap skills, instruction sources, and the official capability marketplace.
- **`@oas-framework/pi`**: minimal pi adapter for instance-local resource
  exposure and memory session events. It registers no agent tools.

Claude instances consume the generated standard files directly through the
instance home's `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md` symlinks. OAS does **not** redirect
Claude's config home: an isolated one cannot authenticate, and the operator's
own Claude configuration is deliberately left enabled.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib/core.mjs` | Souls, instances, config/target resolver, capability discovery, composition, locks/trust, hooks. |
| `bin/oas.mjs` | Agent lifecycle, config, acquisition/trust/activation, doctor, and operational command dispatch. |
| `capabilities/` | Bundled additive packages and layer integrations, each with `oas.json`. |
| `skills/` | Kernel/bootstrap and package-authoring skills. |
| `injects/` | Kernel and work-mode instruction sources. |
| `packages/pi/` | Thin pi adapter. |
| `packages/desktop/` | OAS Desktop — the Electron control panel and its bundled zero-dependency backend server (private, not published). |
| `test/` | Capability resolver/composition/security lifecycle tests. |
| `agents/` | The framework's own portable expert souls. |

Capability discovery has one layout: each config scope's `.agents/capabilities/` split into
`installed/` (acquired, locked, gitignored, restorable via bare `oas install`)
and `owned/` (authored at that scope, config-owned trusted; committed where
the scope is a git repo, plain scope-durable files elsewhere).

The live control panel is the OAS Desktop app (`packages/desktop/`): an
Electron shell over a bundled zero-dependency localhost server that uses
plain OAS metadata/files plus git and tmux; no pi APIs cross into the
feature, so the same surface works for pi and Claude instances. (`oas pane`
and the `oas.web` browser panel were retired in its favor.)

## Instance layout

```text
<agents-root>/<agent>/
  soul/
    soul.yaml
    AGENTS.md                 # canonical role instructions
    CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md
    skills/                   # soul-private skills
  instances/<instance>/
    soul -> ../../soul
    AGENTS.md                 # generated composition (regular file)
    CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md
    .agents/skills/           # exact materialized set
    .claude/skills -> ../.agents/skills
    work/
    TASK.md
    instance.json             # capabilities, skills, instruction sources, lifecycle metadata
```

Knowledge integration hooks may add memory files. The kernel does not assume
their names.

## Resolution

`configChain(context)` loads `oas-config.yaml` from closest scope outward.
`resolveCapabilities(context, soulName)`:

1. resolves explicit group definitions;
2. collects matching global/group/soul bindings;
3. composes settings by target specificity then config closeness;
4. applies explicit enable/exclusion;
5. validates equal-specificity conflicts, IDs, command namespaces, lock
   integrity, and skill/layer collisions; and
6. returns deterministic active capability records with provenance.

`resolveOasConfig` maps active packages declaring `layer` into the exclusive
knowledge/messaging/tasks slots. `layers.<layer>: none` explicitly suppresses
an inherited slot and remains distinct from absence.

## Spawn composition

`spawnInstance` resolves against the soul's repository and soul name. It:

0. resolves and validates WHERE the home will be created, before any side
   effect: the destination must be the agent directory's own `instances/`
   child, that agent directory must lie inside this deployment, and a linked
   worktree maps to the primary checkout — otherwise `E_NO_CANONICAL_ROOT` and
   nothing is created. The check is repeated on the created directory before
   anything is written into it. See
   [souls-and-instances.md](souls-and-instances.md#deployment-prerequisite-the-agents-directory-must-be-operator-owned)
   for the deployment prerequisite this rests on;
1. calls `composeInstanceAgentsMd` without writing the soul;
2. writes generated `AGENTS.md` and canonical compatibility symlinks;
3. copies kernel + soul + active package skill trees into real directories in
   one instance-local root, failing duplicate names unless `skill-overrides`
   chooses a source;
4. creates the selected work topology;
5. runs active hooks in deterministic order; and
6. records capabilities, settings, trust, skill names/sources, instruction
   files, hooks, capability metadata, and forward-only spawn lineage in
   `instance.json`.

Pi launches with `--no-skills --skill <instance-home>/.agents/skills
--no-context-files --no-prompt-templates --append-system-prompt
<instance-home>/AGENTS.md`. The OAS-managed skill set is exactly the composed
one: no user, project, ancestor or package skill catalogs. It is not a claim
that nothing else can reach the session — extensions stay ambient (below), and
what they contribute stays with them.

After the canonical soul and kernel text, every generated `AGENTS.md` states the
runtime-neutral **home/work boundary** (`injects/instance-boundary.md`) — for
every work mode and for capability service agents alike — immediately before the
work-mode block it frames: `<instance-home>` (`$OAS_INSTANCE_HOME`) holds the
brain, task, provenance and working state, and is where OAS operational/lifecycle
commands are run from — together with the commands of whatever capabilities are
active, `aw` among them when aweb messaging is — since they resolve scope from
the working directory (`--dir <path>` reaches another deliberately); the home's
`soul` link is to be treated as read-only because writes through it bypass the
branch and review path; and `<instance-home>/work` is the repository or workspace
view where repository reading, editing, building, testing, git and commits
happen. It bounds *repository* work rather than forbidding all output elsewhere —
episodic state lives in the home, and a service agent's own artifacts (a report
written to a temp file before mailing it) are its role's business. What each mode
actually permits is the work-mode block's call, which follows immediately.

`--no-context-files` also suppresses the instance's *own* composed `AGENTS.md`,
so that is delivered explicitly; the work tree's `AGENTS.md` stays readable by
the file tools — readable, not auto-injected.

Pi **extensions stay ambient**: operators run cross-agent extensions (web
search, output formatting) that every instance should keep, so OAS does not
pass `--no-extensions`. The accepted residue is narrow but real — an
extension's `resources_discover` hook can contribute skill paths that survive
`--no-skills`. Today only the OAS bridge does that, and inside an instance it
contributes that instance's own `.agents/skills`, leaving the composed set
unchanged.

Runtime packages that active capabilities declare (see
[capabilities](capabilities.md)) are verified at spawn and recorded in
`instance.json`; a missing one fails the spawn with the consent command to fix
it, rather than starting an agent whose instructions promise a capability it
does not have. OAS does not resolve their extension entry points — pi owns that
resolution, including globs and conventional directories.

Claude discovers the same set natively through the instance's `.claude/skills`
symlink, and its composed instructions through `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md`.

Claude Code's **own configuration stays enabled**: user and project skills,
plugins, settings and `CLAUDE.md` all resolve into an OAS session as they
normally would. That is a deliberate product choice — those mechanisms are
powerful and the operator decides whether to use them; a deployment that wants
only the OAS-composed surface achieves it by configuring everything OAS-side.
So OAS passes no `--setting-sources`, no exclusions, and no synthetic plugin.

Measured behavior worth knowing when reasoning about an instance: project
skills resolve from the working directory up to the **repository root**, so an
instance homed inside a repository with its own `.claude/skills` sees those
too. Project *settings* — hooks, plugins, permissions, custom agents — resolve
from the instance home rather than from ancestors.

Both runtimes record what they actually expose in `instance.json` under
`composition.materialized.runtimePosture`: the OAS-composed set, what is
curtailed, and what remains ambient. The deviation from strict composition is
auditable rather than implied.

## Instructions

The generated order is:

1. canonical soul content;
2. kernel OAS block;
3. local-soul block (local souls only);
4. **home/work boundary block** — runtime-neutral, every mode and every kind;
5. actual spawn work-mode block;
6. active capability blocks in resolver order; and
7. unconditional config blocks outermost to innermost.

Every generated block carries its source path. `oas doctor --soul <name>` uses
the same composer and prints/returns the final text. Config-dependent prose is
never reconciled into committed souls.

## Acquisition and trust

External installation copies/clones one exact artifact and writes
`oas-lock.json` with source, version/commit, and SHA-256 tree integrity. An
existing destination is never pulled silently. Resolution rejects changed
locked artifacts and unlocked installed/path packages.

Executable package hooks, commands, and launch-environment authority are omitted
until `oas trust <id>` marks the exact locked integrity approved. Bundled
packages are framework-trusted.
Packages under a scope's `owned/` subtree are config-owned. Anything under
`installed/` requires a matching lock entry, so an acquired artifact cannot
bypass executable trust by its directory location.

Distribution packages generalize this: a package materializes each capability it
exports into `.agents/capabilities/installed/<id>/`, each independently
addressable and independently trusted at its own artifact integrity. There is no
persistent package store. The `lockfileVersion: 2` lock records package
provenance (`packages`) and materialized capability identity (`capabilities`)
separately. See `docs/design/package-engine-contract.md` for the resolver/lock
API and error taxonomy.

## Hooks and scaffold ownership

Only `soul-scaffold`, `spawn`, and `retire` manifest hooks are accepted.
Spawn/scaffold use outer-scope then capability-ID order; retire reverses it.
Each hook receives package identity/layer plus structured OAS environment and
may emit a final JSON object containing `meta`, `brief`, `warning`, or `launch`.
Only a spawn hook may add `env`; other lifecycle events reject it rather than
silently discard it. Launch environment is string-only,
size/control-character checked, owned by an unambiguous dotted capability
vendor, and restricted to the manifest's exact trust-visible `environment`
declaration. Capabilities that request this authority must use the stricter
dotted ID form even though capabilities without environment authority retain
the wider namespaced-ID compatibility contract. Explicit and automatic trust
disclose the declaration before persisting authority. Known process-bootstrap
names are denied in depth, not treated as an
exhaustive authority list. Aggregation is deterministic, shell-quoted, and
collision-fatal. It prefixes only the initial runtime command;
values are persisted with that command, so the contract is for non-secret
locators and broker endpoints, never bearer credentials or durable principal
root keys. No restart/replay contract exists. A fatal environment contract error enters
the required-spawn rollback transaction. It runs compensation in reverse,
removes and verifies rollback-owned Git topology, and removes the home only
when cleanup completed. Failed compensation or reported state with no retire
hook uses the same retryable quarantine as every other incomplete spawn.

Soul scaffolding snapshots files around each package hook and records new-file
ownership in `.oas-scaffold-owners.json`. Overwriting canonical or another
package's file restores the prior bytes and raises a conflict.

## Commands

Kernel/package-management commands are always available. Operational
namespaces are discovered from manifest `command`, but dispatch verifies that
`instance.json` or current soul resolution contains the package and that its
locked executable surface is trusted.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
npm run check
npm run check:pi
npm run validate
npm run validate:okf
npm run pack:check
npm run smoke:tarball
```

Pull-request CI runs this matrix on supported Node 22. `validate` compiles both
public JSON schemas, validates clean-contract manifests, parses documented
OAS config examples with the production parser, and checks maintainable public
local links/anchors. `pack:check` dry-runs both npm packages and rejects missing
runtime surfaces or leaked workspace/test state.

The clean-room smoke test packs both packages, installs their tarballs outside
the checkout, verifies the adapter resolves that installed kernel, runs
`init`/`doctor`, and creates/retires a clean-contract scaffold while checking
exact skills, generated instructions, canonical soul immutability, and
metadata.

One manual probe is required after every release and before 0.19.0 ships: from
the **published** kernel (not a checkout), install `oas.authoring` into a fresh
scope, activate it for a framework-author soul, and spawn that soul. The spawn
must succeed with `integration-authoring`, `skill-craft`, and `soul-craft`
materialized in the instance's `.agents/skills/`. Framework-hoisted resources
are resolved by path arithmetic against the installed kernel's own layout, so a
source-tree run can pass while every installed deployment fails.

These deterministic checks deliberately do **not** contact real aweb, Jira, or
Linear services, validate remote git hosting/auth flows, or publish npm
artifacts. Adapter/discovery changes additionally require a disposable real pi
session from the packed artifacts; external services remain credentialed,
out-of-scope probes. Release CI publishes both
packages from one tag; keep versions synchronized because exact pi isolation
depends on both kernel launch and adapter discovery behavior.

Runtime-neutral token/cost/model/tool telemetry for Control Pane remains a
follow-up; it requires an adapter-neutral event contract rather than pi-specific
inspection in the universal CLI.
