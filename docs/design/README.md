# Design records

Dated records of decisions that are still in force: the context, the decision
and its consequences. The current behaviour is explained in the reference pages
([workspaces](../workspaces.md), [packages](../packages.md),
[configuration](../configuration.md), [souls and instances](../souls-and-instances.md),
[capabilities](../capabilities.md), [knowledge](../knowledge.md)); when a record and
a reference page disagree, the reference page wins. Superseded records are
deleted; [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) lists each one, its decision and its
successor, with a link to its full text.

- [Workspace module contracts](2026-09-23-workspace-module-contracts.md): the
  normative contracts of `lib/remote.mjs`, `lib/workspace.mjs`, `lib/resolve.mjs`,
  `lib/packages.mjs`, `lib/materialize.mjs` and the CLI verbs built on them.
- [Knowledge and messaging capability contract](2026-09-16-knowledge-capability-contract.md):
  the kernel supplies contracts; capabilities own knowledge and messaging behaviour.
- [OKF knowledge operations](2026-09-26-okf-knowledge-operations.md): package
  souls, triggers and automations for harvest and maintenance.
- [Team model v2](2026-09-27-team-model-v2.md): shared teams in the workspace,
  local teams, live teams and the provider environment (its membership and
  default-team parts are superseded by team model 3).
- [Team model 3](2026-10-02-team-model-3.md): the teams a soul may join, and
  its default, are committed in the workspace; local teams only where the
  workspace allows them.

The Desktop's design brief for designers is in
[packages/desktop/docs](../../packages/desktop/docs/design-brief.md).
