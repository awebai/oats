// Root test runner for `npm test`.
//
// The suite is still `node --test` over the same globs; the only thing this
// adds is a decision about Desktop suites and root/Desktop integration. They need jsdom, marked,
// dompurify and highlight.js, which are packages/desktop's dependencies and not
// the root's. Handing them to node --test on a checkout that has only run root
// `npm ci` produced 17 ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND failures — the state of every fresh
// clone — which made a red root suite the normal, and therefore ignored, result.
//
// So: run them when they can load, and when they cannot, say so loudly and run
// the rest. The root files that load Desktop modules are explicitly included in
// the same group; their .integration.mjs suffix keeps them out of the root-only
// globs.
// Absence of an optional package's node_modules is a property of the
// checkout, not a defect in the code under test, so this exits 0 in that case;
// nothing is skipped silently. Both CI lanes (.github/workflows/pull-request.yml
// and release.yml) install the desktop dependencies before `npm test`, and
// test/release-workflow.test.mjs pins release.yml's install step, so the skip
// path cannot quietly become CI's normal behaviour.
//
// Any extra arguments are forwarded to node --test.
