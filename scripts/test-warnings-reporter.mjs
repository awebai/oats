// A node:test reporter for the root run (scripts/run-tests.mjs). It shows a person nothing: the
// reporter they read is the other one. It reads what each test file wrote to its stderr and stdout,
// as the run received it, and writes one JSON line to its destination for every line that holds
// `oats: warning:`. The root run fails when there is one.
//
// Test output is pristine (awebai/oats#910): an expected warning is captured and asserted by the
// test or by its fixture, never left in the output. What reaches a file's output is what its
// worker wrote, and what a child wrote whose stderr or stdout the worker gave it as its own. A line
// a child wrote into a pipe the test reads is the test's, and never comes here.
