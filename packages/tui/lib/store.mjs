// collapsed, the filters, where the panes are scrolled) and what the reader gave, exactly as the
// shared rules gave it: each served deployment's entry (deployment-panel.mjs), the roster of other
// machines (remote-roster.mjs `remoteRosterState`) and the memory of what they reported
// (remote-identity-memory.mjs), all through lib/read.mjs. Nothing is added to any of them, nothing
// removed, and nothing here decides what a failed read means or which view a deployment is in.
// Selection is an identity (the shared `instanceId`), never an index, so it survives every read;
// the rows it moves among are the model's, in drawn order.

 *  `ctxs`: the served deployments, in the order they were opened. `open`: the id of the deployment
 *  the Instances view was opened on (a path, or `remote:<group id>`), or null. `entries`,
 *  `numbers`: each served deployment's entry and the number of the cycle that gave it. `remote`,
 *  `rosterAt`, `memory`, `notes`, `collecting`: the roster of other machines as the shared rule
 *  left it, the time of the last outcome taken, what the machines reported, and whether a roster
 *  read is in flight. `unread`: per served deployment whose read failed with nothing kept, the
 *  instances it last held, and `unreadKeys` the memoryKey it was under then (see `took`). `loose`: the list was scrolled away from the selection
 *  on purpose (see `scrolledList`); the switcher has its own.
 *  `selected`, `top`, `detailTop` are the open view's; `places` keeps them, with the filter, for
 *  the workspaces left behind (per lib/model.mjs memoryKey; see `opened`), and `collapsed` holds
 *  every view's keys (each carries its `open`).
 *  `back`: the view under the help. `listed`: this computer's deployments list as it was last read
 *  (awebai/oats#1390): `rows`, the shared reader's `{ path, name, state }` in the kernel's order, of
 *  the last read that answered, and `failure`, the reason (`{ code, message }`) the last read failed
 *  with, or null once one answered. The switcher offers the rows this run does not serve.
 *  `identities`: what the identity reads learned of the rows of that list (lib/main.mjs), path ->
 *  `{ ok: true, workspace }` or `{ ok: false, reason }` (deployment-identity.mjs), the last answer for
 *  each, kept for the run: the switcher matches a listed deployment to its workspace by it, and a
 *  deployment opened from there is in its workspace's view before its first read (lib/model.mjs heldOf).
 *  `opening`: the agent of another machine whose terminal is being opened, or null:
 *  `{ id, phase: "preflight", name, machine, routed }` while that machine is asked whether its
 *  session is there; `name`, `machine` and `routed` are the row's as it was when Enter was
 *  pressed, for the line after. `tabs`: the terminals open in the panel (docs/tui.md, "Tabs"),
 *  in the strips' order (each group's tabs in this order), at most TAB_LIMIT across both groups:
 *  each `{ id, name, machine, routed, status, activity, group }`, `id` the row's instanceId and the
 *  next three the row's as it was when it was opened, `status` "starting" until the panel has its
 *  window, then "open", `activity` true while it is hidden and its agent wrote since it was last
 *  shown, `group` 0 or 1 (docs/tui.md, "Splits"). `split`: null, or "right" or "down" while the
 *  panel is split in two groups; `group` the focused group (where an open goes); `aside` the other
 *  group's shown tab's id, or null (no split, or that group empty). `terminal`: the focused group's
 *  SHOWN tab, or null when no tab is open or the focused group is empty:
 *  `{ id, name, machine, routed, group, focus, zoom, status }`, its tab's fields with `focus`
 *  "terminal" while what is typed goes to the agent and "list" while the TUI reads keys, and `zoom`
 *  true while it has the whole body (only with the terminal's focus).
 *  `outcome`: the line after an open (the model's `{ said, under }`), shown above the panes until
 *  the next key bound to an action, or null; with `once: true` (the list of workspaces' end, said
 *  by the leader's Up or Down, and the leader cancelled by its own read) until the next key of any kind (the leader's: the key after it), one
 *  typed to the agent included, or a resize (the loop's `{ passed }`). `notice`: such a line that came while no view that
 *  draws one at every width was shown (the switcher, the help, a detail or a terminal with the
 *  focus: see `drawsOutcome`), held until one is; or null.
 *  It is the add of the deployment the run started in, refused.
 *  `detachKey`: tui.json's `open.detachKey`, the leader (docs/tui.md, "The leader"; without one,
 *  the default, C-x on every platform: config.mjs defaultDetachKey), and `leaderKey` the key id it is read as
 *  where the TUI reads keys (term/through.mjs backKeyId).
 *  `leader`: `{ read, waiting }` from the leader's read on, or null (see `leading`).
 *  `keyboard`: the flags the terminal confirmed for the kitty keyboard protocol (lib/main.mjs, the
 *  event `{ keyboard }`), or null while it has not; `chords`: the chords of `platform`, key id ->
 *  `does` (actions.mjs chordKeys), in the family keys.json chose, but the one the leader's key
 *  takes, every one read while `keyboard` is not null, and those with bytes of their own while it
 *  is null: the whole Alt family, the arrows of the others (actions.mjs chordsRead; see `leading`). `keysRead`: what keys.json said at the start (lib/config.mjs loadKeys, the shared
 *  reader's frozen `{ family, why }`; no file when none is given): the family `chords` are bound
 *  in, and why it is the default when the file did not choose it. The help names both.
 *  `palette`: the palette while it is open (see `paletteOpened`), or null; `paletteKeys` its own
 *  keys on `platform`, key id -> `does` (actions.mjs paletteKeys: none on macOS), which win over
 *  every other key while it is open. `recent`: per workspace (memoryKey), the ids of its instances
 *  opened or shown in this run, the latest first (recentWith).
 *  `layouts`: per workspace left behind, its tabs as they were (layoutOf); `restoring`: the restore
 *  of the open workspace's while it opens them again (`{ key, tabs, split, group, shown, focus,
 *  zoom, queue, grant }`: the layout, the tabs not opened yet, and whether the focus is still given
 *  back), or null (restoreNext); `leftFocus`: `{ id, zoom }` while another view stands over the list
 *  and the terminal had the focus before it, or null (reduceStep).
 *  `act`: the confirmation open in the act view (see `actOpened`), or null; `acted` counts the
 *  confirmations opened in this run, so an answer for one that was closed is told apart.
 *  `starting`: id -> `{ verb, since }` of this run's starts and restarts whose child is still
 *  alive, whether or not the TUI still waits for its answer (the loop says when one is spawned and
 *  when it closes): no act opens on such a row.
 *  `retiring`: the instanceIds of the rows whose retire this run sent and has not read since
 *  (#1247), as lib/main.mjs's tracker says them (`{ retiring }`): they read as retiring. The roster
 *  is made from it (lib/model.mjs MADE_FROM), and from none of `opening`, `terminal`, `outcome`,
 *  `act`, `acted`, `starting`, `leader`, `palette` and `recent`.
 *  A SPAWN (docs/tui.md, "Spawning an agent"; see `spawnAsked`): `spawn` the prompt while it is
 *  open, or null; `spawning` the one spawn under way, `{ name, soul, workspace, phase, prompt }`
 *  (`phase` "submitting", "spawning" or "checking"; `prompt` the prompt as it was pressed, to come
 *  back to), or null; `spawnCheck` `{ name }` while a check of an outcome not known is offered
 *  (`C`), or null; `arriving` the instance a spawn created, `{ workspace, instance, home,
 *  agentsRoot, agent, reads, words }`, until its row is opened or two reads did not show it;
 *  `previews` the number of the last preview read asked in the run, so that an answer to a prompt
 *  already closed is never taken by the next one. */
