// The action table: what the TUI can do and the keys that do it. The reducer and the help view
// both read it, so the help cannot name a key the program does not act on. `keys` are key ids
// (term/keys.mjs keyId); they are the part a user's tui.json replaces (config.mjs), so everything
// that acts on a key or names one reads the EFFECTIVE table it is handed, never this constant.
// An action that does one thing in the list of instances and another in the switcher (`open`)
// says so in `views`: what it does in each, in the order the help lists them. An action of one
// view only (the four acts) names that view, so the help says where it acts.
// The keys the TUI shares with the Desktop are not written here: an action with no `keys` of its own
// takes its default keys from the shared keymap (packages/client/keymap.mjs PLAIN_KEYS), and the
// leader's table is the shared one (LEADER, below). What only the TUI has (q, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+L,
// Ctrl+K, Tab, Esc, Delete, C, i) keeps its keys here. packages/tui/test/keymap.test.mjs pins both.
