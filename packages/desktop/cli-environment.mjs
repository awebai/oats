 *     Info.plist declares on macOS; a user's own "0" cannot be told from it).
 *  3. With a mount: APPIMAGE, APPDIR, ARGV0 and OWD are removed, and every other value is read
 *     as a `:` list (APPDIR exists only where an AppImage does, so `:` and not path.delimiter).
 *     An entry is under the mount when it is the mount or starts with the mount and a `/`. A
 *     value with no such entry is passed through as it is, not re-joined. Otherwise those
 *     entries and the empty ones are dropped, and the name is removed when nothing is left.
 * Without a mount step 3 does nothing. A value that is not a string is never read and passes
 * through. The rule is on values, not on the names the AppImage launcher exports, so it holds
 * whatever that generated script exports; it matches whole entries only, so a value that merely
 * contains the mount's path, or a sibling of the mount, is untouched. Applying it to its own
 * result changes nothing.
