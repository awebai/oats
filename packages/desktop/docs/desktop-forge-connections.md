# Desktop forge connections

Connections are **workstation/ADE accounts**, not capabilities. Settings →
Connections contains the GitHub card; the selected instance's Git & GitHub panel
shows pull-request facts. Every local workspace uses gh's native account store.
No OATS config, soul, instance, lock or catalog is changed. GitLab and automatic
PR creation are not implemented by this surface.

The accepted product decision is
`agents/oats-expert/soul/knowledge/decisions/p1-forge-connection-is-an-ade-integration.md`.

## Installed CLI and credential custody

Desktop requires a released **GitHub CLI >=2.81.0 <3**. It discovers an absolute,
regular executable from process PATH or bounded native installation locations,
then requires a successful `--version` probe. A missing binary reports
`cli-not-installed`; an old/unrecognized version reports `E_GH_VERSION` with a
literal installation hint. There is no text-mode fallback, installation, login
shell discovery or renderer-selected executable.

Only gh reads/writes its native authentication store. Desktop never reads gh's
configuration files, invokes `auth token`/`--show-token`/`--with-token`, persists
credentials, or forwards subprocess diagnostics. Its child environment preserves
native profile/keychain/network settings while excluding GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN,
enterprise token overrides, GH_HOST/GH_REPO, debug, pager, browser-command and
Git/loader overrides. Server and main verify the same native-profile identity.

Status uses fixed `auth status --active --json hosts --jq <literal projection>`.
The projection retains only validated host/account/state fields and a closed
error category. In JSON mode **exit zero is not proof of authentication**. A
successful active account must also match the result of
`api user --hostname HOST --jq .login`. Authentication refusal, unavailable
transport, malformed output and missing CLI remain distinct; stdout/stderr do
not become UI messages. No status or PR polling timer is installed.

Admitted hosts are github.com and hosts reported by gh itself. An unknown
Enterprise remote is unsupported, with the literal remedy to configure it using
GitHub CLI first (`gh auth login --hostname <host>` from a terminal). There is no
arbitrary hostname field or inference that an arbitrary remote is GitHub.
Process-local host references expire after 15 minutes; account/action references
after 120 seconds without renewal. Each registry has a hard cap of 32. This lets
a just-disconnected Enterprise host show Not connected/Reconnect temporarily,
without persisting a connection-fact cache.

## Read-only HTTP boundaries

Both new routes are POSTs behind the existing loopback Host and POST Origin
guards. Neither command execution nor auth mutation is exposed through GET.
Requests are JSON objects bounded to 64 KiB. Unknown fields refuse.

- **POST `/api/forge-connections`**: no query parameters. Empty body selects the
  default GitHub host; `{hostRef}` selects an opaque, already-admitted host or
  account reference. This is machine-scoped and does not require a workspace or
  compatible OATS installation. It returns a `forgeApi:1` connection state,
  selected host/login, opaque references, bounded host choices, read epoch/time,
  and typed executable/profile metadata for main-process revalidation.
- **POST `/api/instance-forge?ws=<id>`**: exactly one advertised workspace, no
  extra query parameters; strict `{selector, observationKey}`. Selector uses
  K1's instance/agent/agentsRoot/server tuple. The server resolves the exact home
  and scope from its own roster. Missing/ambiguous targets and remote
  workspaces/instances refuse **before any process**. Main's proxy pins this
  route to its verified workspace set.

The installed K1 response must have its own `remote` field; this is a **presence
check**, not an OATS0.24.8 version check. Absent means unavailable; explicit null
means no-remote; a local path or unrecognized host is unsupported. The existing
K1 compatibility/instanceGitApi gates remain in force. Desktop does not run Git.

K1's `remote.url` can contain userinfo: **it is never forwarded or logged**. The
server projects validated host/path privately and adds a keyed, opaque
`observationKey` to its Git response envelope. The fingerprint includes the
exact target/CLI, worktree, revision, branch and remote selection. It is only a
comparison guard; it never becomes a CLI argument. The PR boundary observes K1
before and after the gh read, refusing if the comparison key/target/scope moved.
Answers echo the target and K1 revision/branch/key they were computed for.

Fixed PR argv:

```text
gh pr view --repo HOST/OWNER/REPO \
  --json number,title,state,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,url,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,updatedAt \
  -- BRANCH
```

Host, repository and branch come exclusively from K1. The end-of-options marker
prevents branch-as-option interpretation, and returned `headRefName` must match
exactly (including numeric-branch/PR-selector ambiguity). Only gh's closed
`no pull requests found for branch "…"` diagnostic for this branch means
no-pull-request. Other failures are unavailable.

Four forge reads can be in flight; identical requests coalesce before the cap.
Discovery and host-status work also coalesce. A proxy-owned read-epoch header,
which overwrites any renderer spelling, partitions pre/post-auth flights. There
is no persistent response cache. Each gh read is limited to 10 seconds; probe
2 seconds, discovery5 seconds; PR stdout1 MiB, status64 KiB, stderr16 KiB.
K1 calls retain their15-second cap within the PR request's45-second total budget
(proxy50 seconds). Connections uses20 seconds (proxy25 seconds). Limits and
failures release flights and return closed local messages.

## Connect and Disconnect: privileged main only

There is **no HTTP login/logout endpoint**. Narrow preload channels request
Connect/Disconnect by opaque connection reference. Main re-reads that reference,
checks the absolute binary/version/stamp and native profile, and validates the
trusted **top-level** senderFrame. Other frames, windows, leases and malformed
arguments resolve stable domain refusals. All preparation, dialogs and PTYs
share one main-owned authentication-operation slot.

Connect prepares only:

```text
gh auth login --web --skip-ssh-key --hostname HOST
```

This is a separate ephemeral node-pty broker, never an agent terminal, shell,
tmux viewer or arbitrary executable/argv/cwd API. The UI labels it exactly:

> GitHub CLI sign-in · live terminal output from `gh`

It has 200 lines of ephemeral scrollback, a1 MiB output ceiling and a15-minute
hard lifetime. Output listeners are installed before the first resize/ready
handshake starts gh. Input is a closed enum: Enter/arrows/Tab/Escape/y/n/Ctrl-C.
There is no byte/paste/token-input or attachment channel. Shift+Tab leaves the
terminal so keyboard users can reach Close sign-in. OSC/clipboard/link controls
and terminal string-control payloads are discarded; no hyperlink addon is
installed. No transcript, log or crash-diagnostic persistence is added.

**Explicit residual:** this pane displays live process output, not typed
connection facts. Known credential-pattern redaction occurs before IPC, across
chunk and ANSI boundaries, but is **best-effort against a defective executable**.
Official gh without debug/`--show-token` does not print the access token. An
arbitrary byte stream cannot honestly be certified secret-free. The operator
completes gh's own web/device flow; Desktop does not extract a device code into a
new credential UI.

Closing/cancelling/navigation/renderer death/quit affects only the owned gh child
and lease. A workspace switch cannot retarget its input. A prepared operation is
refused if the backend generation or executable stamp changes before starting.
Existing agent tmux anchoring, linked-window viewers, locked keys and detach-only
closure are unchanged.

Disconnect shows a main-owned confirmation naming the current account and host.
It explains that this affects all workspaces/other uses of that gh account and
**does not revoke the token on GitHub**. After confirmation the account, host,
profile, binary and owner are revalidated, then only:

```text
gh auth logout --hostname HOST --user LOGIN
```

is run. An action receipt never asserts that the host is disconnected: gh may
have selected another stored account. Auth start and every end/cancel increment
the connection generation; fresh status/PR reads determine what is shown.

## Rendering and verification

Connection states: connected (login+host), not-connected, cli-not-installed,
unavailable. PR states add available, no-pull-request, unsupported-forge and
no-remote. Unknown is not empty, passing, or authenticated. PR text is inert;
links must be HTTPS for the exact admitted host/repository/number, without
userinfo/query authority, and use the existing external-open path.

The card labels checks **Reported PR checks**. CheckRun and StatusContext are
separate producer unions; only known states map to pass/fail/pending, while
neutral/skipped are explicit. Null checks are not an observed empty list. The
requested fields do not establish exhaustive pagination or bind checks to the
local HEAD: **K1 revision is correlation, not push proof**. No auto-PR, review
thread delivery, merge, commit or push is inferred or implemented.

Renderer reads are guarded on success and rejection by lifetime/selection,
workspace generation, observation and request tickets, plus connection
generation. The auth pane has a separate open intent so its own Connect event
cannot revoke itself. Stale controls and close/reopen completions cannot act on
a newer selection or lease.

Tests use inert CLI/PTY/dialog fixtures, a generated fake executable, the shipped
HTTP callback and DOM/CSSOM; no native gh authentication or GUI launch is needed.
Computed three-theme contrast is not native rendering evidence. Operator/CI
owns final native authentication, keyboard and rendered acceptance.

## Roster pull requests (forge-roster)

`POST /api/forge-roster?ws=<id>` with `{}` answers the pull request of each
LOCAL instance's branch, for the roster:
`{ forgeApi: 1, status: "ok", rows: [{ home, number, state, isDraft, url }], reason: null, readEpoch, observedAt }`.

- **The repository is the kernel's.** `workspace status` `clones[]` (feature
  `desktop-facts`) names each member's key and this computer's clone path. An
  instance maps to the member whose clone contains its recorded `repo`,
  compared after realpath on both sides. The longest containing clone wins, and
  a non-github member there claims its paths. The Desktop derives no remote.
- **Only** `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` keys are read, only for instances with a
  branch, at most 20 distinct (repo, branch) per read. Anything else gets no row,
  never a guess, and an instance without a pull request has no row.
- `gh` runs as this host's own auth: no token in argv, env or output. A missing
  or signed-out `gh` answers `E_GH_UNAVAILABLE`.
- One flight per workspace under the shared forge cap (`E_FORGE_BUSY`). Results
  are cached for 60 s. A remote workspace is `unsupported-remote-operation`.
- The app proxy classifies it as a forge route (frame guard, epoch header,
  50 s) and pins the verified workspace.

## W6 pull-request facts

The single-PR read (`/api/instance-forge`) carries three more facts. Each is
null when gh does not report it, never computed or guessed:

- `closingIssues: [{ number, url }] | null`: gh's `closingIssuesReferences`,
  as https issue pages on the same forge (at most 100). Anything else refuses
  the PR like any other malformed field.
- `unresolvedThreads: number | null`: `gh pr view` has no review threads, so
  one `gh api graphql` read (the host's own auth; typed `-F` variables; the
  same cap and deadline) counts the unresolved ones. More than 100 threads, or
  anything unreadable, is `null`. The roster read never makes this call.
- Each `checks[]` row has `startedAt` and `completedAt` as gh reports them
  (ISO strings, or null; gh's zero time `0001-…` is null).

The renderer's re-validation (`projectedPullRequest`) round-trips all three.
