// Server host — owns the app's backend-server child process lifecycle and the
// ownership/trust-state transitions. Extracted from main.mjs so the REAL
// production seam is importable in tests (review wsadd3: regressions that
// reimplement `|| transition` or cache invalidation in mocks pin nothing —
// deleting the production line left them green).
//
// Invariants owned here:
//  - ownership persists across a replacement (owned() is true from the
//    moment replace() starts until it finishes) — adds arriving mid-
//    transition queue instead of failing foreign;
//  - a child's late exit can only clear the reference to ITSELF, never to
//    a successor;
//  - replace() awaits the old child's actual exit (SIGKILL fallback) before
//    the caller rebinds the port, and invalidates the advertised trust
//    state at transition start via onInvalidate() — stale entries from the
//    outgoing server must never validate anything.
//  - the child's stdin is the owner lifeline (#698): a pipe whose write end
//    only this process holds, never written to and never ended. When this
//    process ends by any path (quit, crash, SIGKILL) the kernel closes it, and
//    the server, started with --exit-on-stdin-close, sees EOF and exits.
//    Node creates the pipe close-on-exec, so no other child (CLI runs, ptys,
//    a tmux server) inherits the write end and keeps the server alive.
