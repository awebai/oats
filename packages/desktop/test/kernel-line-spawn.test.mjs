// With a released kernel of the 0.25 line, can a person reach the Spawn dialog's preview? No, and no one
// function says so: the answer crosses the server's snapshot and a view. This file follows the value from the
// kernel's probe to the dialog, through the shipped server process and the shipped Spawn view.
//
// The probe is the released kernel's own: `fixtures/kernel-line/v0.25.9-version.json` is the standard output,
// byte for byte, of `oats version --json` run from an export of the tag `v0.25.9` (`git archive v0.25.9 bin lib
// package.json packages/record`, with the `yaml` and `croner` versions that tag pins). The tag is a pins-only
// release, so its CLI prints version 0.25.8. It lists `spawn-preview-2`, so the dialog's own preview gate is
// open, and it does not list `packages-no-approval`, which arrived with 0.26.0.
//
// The chain, each step read by the test below:
//   1. the kernel is accepted (cli-locator.mjs `acceptProbe`): nothing below is the answer of a missing CLI;
//   2. the deployment observer asks `deploymentReadGate` before any read (deployment-observer.mjs `admit`),
//      and the refusal becomes an unavailable entry that keeps nothing (deployment-panel.mjs `failedEntry`);
//      the souls read stops the same way (workspace-cli.mjs `workspaceGate`), so the kernel runs no read at all;
//   3. the server lists souls only for an observed deployment (oats-web.mjs `agentsData`): none;
//   4. the preview's boundary admits a soul only from that list (server/spawn-preview.mjs
//      `admitSpawnSelection`): E_SOUL_UNKNOWN, before the kernel is asked;
//   5. the view opens the dialog only for a soul of that list (views/spawn.mjs `canLaunchSoul`): no card, no
//      Spawn control, and Quick Open's way in finds nothing. It says why in the client's own sentence.
// The stand-in kernel (helpers/load-path-server.mjs) answers every read it is asked, souls included, whatever
// the probe says. So what is missing below is withheld by the Desktop's gates alone, and the same server,
// request and view reach the kernel's preview once the probe is the helper's own.
