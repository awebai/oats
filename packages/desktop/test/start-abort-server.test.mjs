// A client never ends a start. Main's api proxy gives up on a start or restart at its deadline (and gave up
// at 20 s before it had one of its own): this runs the shipped server over a scripted fake kernel
// (helpers/load-path-server.mjs) and aborts the request while the CLI call is in flight. The call is held
// at a gate, so every step is controlled, never timed: it is still running after the client has gone, it
// ends only when the test lets it, by its own exit, and the route goes on after it.
// The fake kernel has no signal handler: a signalled call would die at its gate and never log its end.
