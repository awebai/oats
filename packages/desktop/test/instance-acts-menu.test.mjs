// is the menu it was. The proof is a capture: fixtures/instance-menu/before-instance-acts.json is what
// helpers/instance-menu-probe.mjs reported for every row of its table on the code before the rebuild (the
// fixture names the commit). The same probe runs here on the menu as it is now.
//
// #1559 removed the menu's ⋯ trigger: the menu opens from its row (a right-click, Shift+F10, the Menu key). The
// capture is left as it was taken; `asContextMenu` maps what it says of the trigger onto the row, and its own test
// proves the mapping drops nothing but the trigger's own name.
//
// One difference, named below: a remote row the kernel does not report addressable used to carry items in a
// menu that no path could open; it now carries none. The capture proves they could not be reached before,
// and the probe proves the menu still cannot be opened.
