// Artifact inventory — dormant-surface absence proof (desktop-dist contract).
//
// Desktop 0.18 deletes the dormant Diff and Jira surfaces entirely: modules,
// routes, helpers, tests, styles, imports, and harness entries. This suite
// pins the ABSENCE so a stray revert or cherry-pick cannot silently reship
// them. Markdown's /api/file stays (contract keeps it), and the framework's
// separate oats.jira capability is out of scope here.
//
// The second half (below the absence proof) is the shipped module graph: every
// file the builder ships is read, never imported, and each path it reaches must
// be in the package at the place the source expects it. That is what lets a
// shipped module import the shared home (packages/client) by a plain relative
// path without a copy or install step that could go stale.
