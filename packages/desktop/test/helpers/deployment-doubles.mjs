/** Doubles for the workspace-view functions the shipped HTTP handler (server/oats-web.mjs) calls
 * (#482; the real ones are packages/client/panel-views.mjs), over a plain list of deployments where every
 * deployment is its own one-deployment view (the view id IS the deployment id, as for an unattached
 * deployment). They mirror the real functions for that case, with the arguments the server passes:
 * - `held()`: what the server holds, here one fixed object the doubles read nothing of;
 * - `deployments(held)`: the list, read on every call (tests mutate it or count lookups);
 * - `deploymentFor(held, id, terms)`: the exact deployment, or the first one when no id is given, else null;
 * - `surfaceDeployment(held, id, request, terms)`: exact id only when the body names an instance home
 *   (`selector.home` / `spec.home`), else deploymentFor;
 * - `isServed(held, id, terms)`: the id is a listed deployment.
 * Each refuses a call that does not pass `held()` first, and the Desktop's terms where the real function
 * takes terms: a route that forgot either fails here, not only where the real function runs.
 * Tests that need real views use test/helpers/workspace-views-fixture.mjs instead. */
