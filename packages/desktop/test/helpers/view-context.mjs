// The shell bindings the workspace-views change (#482) added to the roster functions that the
// source-extraction tests run in a vm context: the shown view's deployments (none: a window looks
// as before views), the roster sections and headings, and the re-homing seam. A test about
// re-homing passes its own `rehomeWorkspaceState`. Spec D's needs-input gate, roll-up and sentence are
// pure and shared the same way, with the tab sync's last-painted-roster state (#558).
// #982's lines that say who made a row's text or a kept failure's message (renderer/speaker-line.mjs), and the
// shared home's rule for a kept failure (deployment-facts.mjs keptFailure), are pure and shared the same way.
// #1247: the window's retires in flight. A suite about other behaviour holds none: rows are drawn as the roster
// says (`shownRows` the identity) and a read lets nothing go; a suite about them passes the shipped ones.
// A workspace switch's focus place (focus-place.mjs) is inert the same way.
// #1579: the Background section's placement, section key and heading are pure and shared the same way; a suite
// about other behaviour runs without the kernel's feature (`backgroundShown`), so nothing moves, and its sections
// are closed (`backgroundOpen`). background-sidebar.test.mjs turns the feature on.
