/* oats desktop — view-local key dispatch resolved through the engine keymap.
   Views own single-key shortcuts scoped to their focused surface (hierarchy
   canvas, spawn grid): dispatch stays DOM-local so typing in inputs is never
   affected, but the CHORD each action answers to comes from the engine —
   getBinding resolves user override ?? DEFAULT_KEYMAP ?? registration
   defaultChord, and a persisted explicit unbind (Backspace in the editor)
   returns null, which makes the key DEAD here too. One source of truth
   (review 4f57091: no local chord fallback — a resolver-side default would
   resurrect explicitly unbound shortcuts and split the keymap authority
   addendum 3 unified). */
