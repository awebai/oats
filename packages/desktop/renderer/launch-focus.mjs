/** A launch's `--instance <name>` (D3 of awebai/oats#1665): the window of the `--dir` deployment selects that
 * instance's roster row, as "show in roster" does (shell.mjs showInRoster: the row is revealed and takes keyboard
 * focus). It only selects: nothing starts, attaches or is written, and nothing is read beyond the roster reads the
 * window makes anyway.
 *
 * Main reads the argument (single-instance.mjs launchInstance) and sends the window `{ deployment, name }`, a name
 * the kernel's instance-name check takes, or `{ invalid: true }`, which never carries the value.
 * - The name counts only on rows of that deployment, on this computer (a home still being set up included):
 *   another deployment of the view, or a remote row, never matches and never makes a duplicate.
 * - One row: it is selected on the first roster read that lists it. Two or more: nothing is selected, and the window
 *   says so.
 * - None yet (a spawn still finishing): the request waits for the roster's next reads, up to
 *   LAUNCH_FOCUS_PENDING_MS, then the window says the name is not in this workspace.
 * - A person's choice wins: the request is dropped, silently, once the person selects anything (the shell's
 *   selection-ownership ticket, taken at the first roster read, when the window is bound to its workspace) or
 *   produces input or presses a pointer (spawn-follow.mjs watchOperator). A later launch's request replaces it.
 * Notices are text, and name only a validated name. DOM-free. */
