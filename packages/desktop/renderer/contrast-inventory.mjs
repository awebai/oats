/* oats desktop — the contrast inventory: which foreground token is drawn on
   which surface token. Token names only, never a colour value.

   One list, two consumers:
   - `test/theme-contrast.test.mjs` holds every built-in palette (White,
     Solarized, Dark) to it;
   - `host-theme.mjs` derives the "This computer" theme from it: each imported
     text colour is moved until it meets the ratio on every surface listed for
     it here, and the same test file holds the derived palettes to the list.

   A rule that paints a new foreground on a surface adds its pair here, and both
   consumers follow. */
