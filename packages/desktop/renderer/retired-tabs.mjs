/* oats desktop — which terminal tabs a roster answer shows retired (#1237). Pure: the shell closes the
   ids it answers (shell.mjs `closeRetiredTabs`), on an owned, observed roster answer only.

   A terminal tab is bound to ONE incarnation of an instance: its key (instance-tree-view.mjs
   `terminalKey`: workspace + home) and the row's `createdAt`, the kernel's incarnation of a home,
   recorded on the tab at open (`terminalOrigin`) with the row's deployment and server. A roster row
   with the same home and another `createdAt` is a different instance: it never shows in, or activates,
   the old tab (`tabShowsRow`).

   A tab is retired when the answer proves it, and only then (fail closed: keep the tab). (R) and (G) are a row's
   own facts, so they count only from a current read of that row's deployment (the facts of (A) below): a row held
   from an unreached, kept or unasked read keeps whatever it was last read with.
   (R) Replaced: every row with the tab's identity reports a `createdAt` string, and none is the one the
       tab recorded. Null or absent on either side is no evidence (an older kernel, a saved route).
   (G) Gone on its host: every row with the tab's identity is a remote row the kernel reports
       `missingRemotely: true` (the host was reached and did not list it; lib/servers.mjs).
   (A) Absent from a good read: no row has the tab's identity, and this answer carries a successful,
       current read of the deployment the tab came from. The panel facts that prove it
       (client/panel-views.mjs `deploymentInfo` / `deploymentEntry`, `panelData`):
       - exactly one `deployments[]` entry has the tab's recorded deployment id, of the tab's kind
         (`local: true` for a local tab, `local: false` for a remote one);
       - it is `reachable: true`: a local deployment whose observation is `observed` (not pending, not
         unavailable), a remote group whose probe reached its host this read;
       - it is not `stale`: no failed re-read kept the last observation (local), and a filtered read
         asked for it (remote, #1124: a kept group is stale);
       - as the view's primary, the panel carries no kept `error` (deployment-facts.mjs `keptFailure`);
       - no row of that deployment says `serverUnreached`.
       Anything else — a deployment that left the view or that a rehome moved to an id the tab did not
       record, a deployment the read did not ask, a kept failure, an unreached server, a pending or
       empty answer — proves nothing.
   Never evidence: the PTY ending (Stop ends it too), `running: false`, `retirePending`,
   `rollbackIncomplete`, `addressable: false`, a reconnect failure, the Desktop's own retire receipt. */
