/* oats desktop — what the leader's table means in the Desktop (pure).

   The table itself is the shared one (packages/client/keymap.mjs LEADER_TABLE, the TUI's, with
   its terse labels). Here: the Desktop's word for each `does`, which rows apply in the window's
   present state (a key whose row does not apply now still settles, and the shell says why in the
   hint's line: shell.mjs onSettle, notApplicable. Only `m`, which the Desktop has no operation
   for, cancels like a key outside the table), and how a key id is drawn (the shortcuts editor's
   Leader group lists the rows). The shell supplies the state and runs the
   rows (shell.mjs, leader-dispatch.mjs); docs/desktop-keyboard.md, "The leader", is the table. */
