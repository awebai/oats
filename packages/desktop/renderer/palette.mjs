/* oats desktop — command palette (app.palette: ⌘K on macOS, Ctrl+Alt+K on
   Linux/Windows; the keymap engine owns the chord and its terminal policy).
   One input, two result kinds: instances (default; jump-to-terminal) and
   commands (also matched by name — ">" prefix restricts to commands).
   Instances are the sidebar's tree ordered by last focus (#1383): the sidebar's
   deployment sections, relation groups and depth, from its own builders
   (packages/client: rosterSections, roster-sections.mjs; rosterGroups and
   recencyOrder, instance-tree.mjs), given the workspace's last-focus record.
   At every level (a deployment's section, a relation cluster, a cluster's roots,
   a parent's children) a node sits where the most recently focused instance of
   its subtree puts it; never-focused nodes keep the sidebar's order after the
   rest; a child stays under its parent. This supersedes Spec C's flat Recent
   group; the record is still instance-recency.mjs, and the sidebar keeps its
   stable name order. The order is decided on the full roster: a query decides
   only which rows show, each match with its non-matching ancestors as disabled
   context rows. Each row carries the sidebar row's connectors (treeConnectors,
   instance-tree-view.mjs) and state; an instance at either end of an explicit
   sibling link (#1312; instanceSiblings, resolved per deployment over its full
   roster) says "sibling of <name>" to assistive technology, as a child says
   "under <parent>": the dotted line carries siblinghood visibly. The palette
   opens on its first selectable row: the top of the list, which the order makes
   the most recently focused path (with a query, the first match; #1391).
   While open, the palette's own chord moves the active row down (Shift + the
   chord: up), skipping context rows.
   Overlay chrome lives in overlay-picker.mjs (shared with Quick Open), the fuzzy
   matcher in packages/client/subsequence-score.mjs (shared with the TUI); this
   module owns only the palette's row semantics. */

 * Every instance is listed once, in the sidebar's tree ordered by `recent`

 * over the row's cluster as listed and its deployment's full roster, `state` is
 * runtimeState (running, stopped or unknown), `under` "under <parent>" for a
 * child; a row of an instance with a sibling by explicit link carries
 * `sibling: "sibling of <names>"` (siblingText over instanceSiblings, built per
 * deployment over its full roster as the sidebar resolves relations, never over
 * the listed rows), and a row without one has no `sibling` field. An ancestor
 * shown only as a match's context carries { context: true } and no run. No row
