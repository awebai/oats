/* The workspace list (docs/desktop.md, "Workspaces"): always shown at the top of the sidebar, one row per
   workspace this window can show, whatever machine it is on: the served views, remote-only ones included, then
   the views no workspace identity matched, in the same flat list. A row is one line, the instance roster's circle
   and the workspace's name: no machine, no state. The current row is `aria-current` and marked by style alone (its
   circle filled, its name bold); picking a row (a
   click, Enter or a move) shows it in this window, taking it over from another window that shows it (#481 as
   changed: never focus the other window). A row with an instance that needs input carries the needs-input mark (.attn-mark) at its far right
   (and the words, for assistive tech and in its tooltip), from the served views' roll-up alone.

   A list of buttons, not a listbox (the sidebar's plain keys stay live on it): one tab stop (the current row,
   else the row last focused), Up/Down/Home/End move, Enter opens. ⌘Enter / Ctrl+Enter opens a row in a new
   window, and so does its context menu (a right-click, Shift+F10 or the Menu key): no button is drawn for it.
   `step(±1)` (the leader's ↑/↓) selects the previous / next row, as a click does, wrapping at the ends.

   This computer's deployments not opened are not rows: Add local workspace… offers them, each one a button that
   adds it and opens it here (#518), and after them the rows of this computer's list that can't be opened, each
