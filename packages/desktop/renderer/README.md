# oats desktop — renderer views (webpanel-dev)

Ports of the retired browser panel's functionality as desktop renderer views,
per the desktop-app contract: each view is a plain ES module exporting
`mount(el, ctx)` / `unmount()`, where `ctx = { api(pathname, opts),
openFile(path), openTerminal(instance) }` is provided by the shell.
No frameworks, no dependencies; data comes from the bundled backend HTTP API.

## Views (`views/`)

- **spawn.mjs** — available agents (`GET /api/agents`) with spawn-from-app
  (`POST /api/spawn`), purpose/task fields. Panel defaults hold: empty task
  spawns an instance awaiting instructions; attached-mode agents are not
  spawnable standalone. Without a compatible installed `oats` CLI the view
  shows the shared degradation card and disables Spawn consistently.
- **cli-status.mjs** — shared CLI degradation state + the ONE card
  (detected path/version, required range, **Choose oats…**, **Retry**, docs
  link, copyable install command). Views subscribe via `onCliChange`;
  re-probe triggers: launch, app focus, Retry, choose (contract).
- **common.mjs** — shared helpers: escaping, mini-markdown, ctx.api JSON
  wrappers, roster grouping, and workspace switching (`?ws=`) — the selected
  workspace is shared across views via `setWorkspace`/`onWorkspaceChange`
  (persisted in localStorage), so a shell-level switcher can drive it too.

`theme.css` carries the panel's semantic design tokens (dark + solarised
light, WCAG AA); views style themselves against tokens only, scoped under
`.oats-view` so shell chrome is unaffected.

## Keybindings (shell-level)

- **keybindings.mjs** — the keymap engine: action registry
  (`registerAction`/`setActiveContexts`; a registration may carry a
  `defaultChord` that folds into the effective keymap like a
  `DEFAULT_KEYMAP` entry — override wins, explicit unbind kills it),
  `DEFAULT_KEYMAP`, user overrides
  persisted under `localStorage["oats-desktop-keymap"]`, chord
  parse/format/match, and dispatch (`matchEvent`/`handleKeydown`). The engine
  skips already-consumed (`defaultPrevented`) events, and unmodified/
  shift-only chords never fire while an editable field (input, textarea,
  select, contenteditable) has focus. Terminal
  policy: inside `.xterm`, on macOS only ⌘-resolved chords fire; on
  Linux/Windows only `TERMINAL_ALLOWLIST` action ids (palette, tab
  next/prev/close) may fire — all other Ctrl chords belong to the attached
  program. `app.quickOpenSouls` (Mod+P) is deliberately NOT allowlisted:
  ⌘P fires inside xterm on macOS via the ⌘-chord policy, but Ctrl+P inside
  xterm on Linux/Windows is the shell's history navigation and reaches the
  pty.
- **overlay-picker.mjs** — the shared overlay + fuzzy machinery behind the
  command palette and Quick Open: one input over a listbox
  (arrows/Enter/Esc, aria option pattern), the house subsequence scorer
  (`subsequenceScore`; `null` = no match — prefix bonuses make real scores
  negative), and the stale-load generation guard.
- **quick-open.mjs** — Quick Open for souls (`Mod+P`, also “Souls: quick
  open…” in the palette): fuzzy-find a soul from the Spawn view's data
  source and hand off to the Spawn view's own form flow —
  `views/spawn.mjs` `preselectSoul()` opens the spawn modal for a
  spawnable soul on a verified CLI, and otherwise (attached-only, CLI
  pending/unavailable) focuses the soul's card so the existing degradation
  UI explains the state. No second spawn form exists.
- **keybindings-editor.mjs** — the shortcuts editor dialog (`Mod+,`):
  actions grouped by context, click-to-record (Esc cancels, Backspace
  unbinds), conflict warnings via `findConflict`, per-row reset + reset-all.

## Editor groups (splits) and the hideable sidebar (shell-level)

Splits follow VS Code editor-group semantics (`split-layout.mjs` is the
pure model; `split-dom.mjs` the DOM projection). A split creates PERSISTENT
GROUPS on the tab layer: each group owns an ordered tab list and its own
active tab, and renders its own tab strip (`.group-tabbar`, a per-group
tablist holding the group's REAL tab elements) above its pane inside a
`.group-cell` flex cell of `#tabhost`. The first split seeds group 1 with
ALL of the layer's current terminal tabs (the current tab stays active) and
creates a new empty group that takes focus — the next terminal opened from
any path (sidebar roster, palette, quick-open) lands in the FOCUSED group
(`openTabInFocusedGroup`); group focus follows the active tab (`focusTab`).
Switching tabs within a group, or focusing another group, never dismantles
the split — the layout belongs to the tab layer, not to any tab. The former
pending-slot indirection (split → absorb next terminal) is gone: an empty
focused group with a placeholder plays that role directly. While the split
is visible the top `#tabstrip` row is hidden (each group has its own strip;
keeping the old row would render an empty phantom chrome bar) and the split
controls (`#tab-actions`) ride the focused group's strip. Activating a
non-terminal tab covers the split without destroying group state; closing a
group's last tab collapses the group, and down to one group the flat
single-strip layout returns byte-identical to the non-split shell
(regression-pinned). Closing a group's active tab activates its adjacent
group-mate (else the neighbor group's active tab) — never an unrelated
newer terminal. Clickable controls mirror the chords with no duplicated
logic: the split buttons and the sidebar toggles (rail-footer button + the
thin `#sidebar-restore` edge button shown while hidden) all dispatch the
registered actions through `runAction(id)` — context-gated exactly like
chord dispatch — and their enablement dry-runs the same model transition
via `split-controls.mjs` `splitControlsState`. One chrome per tab means the
tab-a11y roving/aria/close semantics hold PER GROUP (each group strip is a
tablist with a single selected, tabbable trigger; arrows walk the group).

## Terminal focus discipline (shell-level)

Jumping to an instance terminal (palette instance row, sidebar roster row,
post-spawn open) ends with the xterm textarea focused — on the fresh-open
path (`term.focus()` inside the terminal tab's `onReady`) AND on the
already-open activation path: `activateTab(id, { focusContent: true })`
invokes the tab's `focusContent` callback (a terminal tab's is
`term.focus()`). `focusContent` defaults to `false`, so side-effect
activations — workspace-switch restoration, close-fallback — never steal
focus; only user-initiated jumps pass it. `terminal.focusActive` is a
rebindable, editor-visible global action that focuses the active terminal's
input from anywhere; it ships with NO default chord (Ctrl chords belong to
the pty on Linux/Windows and plain keys are guarded off editables — bind
one in the shortcuts editor if wanted).

## Developing without the shell

`harness.html` supplies a stub `ctx` and tab chrome for ALL views — including
the Markdown tab (it prompts for a file path;
`ctx.openFile` routes into the markdown view); `harness-server.mjs`
serves it and proxies `/api/*` to a running backend server (same-origin, so
GETs and guarded POSTs both work exactly as in the real shell):

```sh
node packages/desktop/server/oats-web.mjs start --port 4821 --dir <workspace>
node packages/desktop/renderer/harness-server.mjs --port 4899 --api http://127.0.0.1:4821
open "http://127.0.0.1:4899/"
```
