// OATS Desktop — electron-builder configuration (v0.18.2 public matrix).
//
// Contract (desktop-dist): macOS arm64/x64 DMG+ZIP, Linux x64 AppImage+DEB,
// artifacts named oats-desktop-* under packages/desktop/dist/ (the release
// workflow uploads `desktop-<os>-<arch>` from that glob). macOS bundles are
// AD-HOC SIGNED (identity "-"), NOT Developer ID signed and NOT notarized —
// no Apple credentials exist; certificate auto-discovery stays disabled
// (CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false in CI) so no keychain identity can
// leak in. Ad-hoc signing is deterministic and local to the artifact: no
// secrets, no network. Linux declares tmux as a package dependency (DEB)
// and documents it for AppImage.
//
// A JS config (not JSON) so the file can carry these binding comments and
// compute nothing — keep it static and reviewable.
