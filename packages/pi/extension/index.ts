 * modes/interactive/interactive-mode.js:894-897, as an SDK session.prompt()
 * does) and refuses it while another extension's run (the @awebai/pi welcome)
 * is active. The bridge never sends or alters a message: it holds that prompt
 * on pi's own path, in its input handler and again in before_agent_start (a
 * run can start during the prompt's preflight), until no run is active.
 * pi 1.2 and later count the prompt's own run as active from before its
 * before_agent_start (core/agent-session.js:1392-1397) and queue a message
 * sent meanwhile into that run; their event carries messageType, and there
 * only the input handler holds. A run that an extension behind the bridge starts (or that starts
 * while one awaits) in its own input handling of the prompt, or on a pi
 * before 1.2 in its before_agent_start, can still make pi refuse it, and pi
 * says nothing an extension could act on. Every later prompt is left to pi.
 * A session that shuts down releases the hold.
