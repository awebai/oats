/** An instance name as words, for display only: the label of an instance row in the Desktop's and the TUI's sidebar
 * (the product owner, 0.68.1: "like normal words with a space between them, with the first word with initial capital
 * letter"). Every `-` is a space, a run of them one space, the ends trimmed, and only the first character upper-cased;
 * every other character stays as it was.
 * `oats-expert-maintainer-lanes` → "Oats expert maintainer lanes", `tui-leader-hint-developer-2` →
 * "Tui leader hint developer 2", `x` → "X", `already Words` → "Already Words".
 * The real name stays wherever it identifies the instance (a title, the hover card, a copy, a search, the accessible
 * name, a tab, the CLI): this is the visible label alone. DOM-free and import-free, with no module state. */
