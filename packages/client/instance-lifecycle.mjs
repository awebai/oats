 *           nor by a signal to its group.
 * An apply's answer is awaited APPLY_WAIT_MS. When that passes the boundary answers `unknown` and the apply stays
 * in flight here: its reference, its key, its place as the one apply. Its answer, whenever it comes, is read and
 * kept 30 minutes like any other; the same reference meanwhile is answered at once (`unknown` while it runs, the
 * kept answer with `repeated` after). The cost: a CLI that never answers holds this client's applies until the
 * client is restarted; killing it instead could strand the instance (#889; a stop on a kernel before 0.52.0).
 * Every reply given because this client's own apply is running carries `running: { target, operation, since }`:
 * the busy refusal of another apply, and the `unknown` of that apply after its wait. The kernel's own
 * E_LIFECYCLE_BUSY never carries it, and this client's busy refusal carries no `details`, so the kernel's busy
 * holder (lifecycle-contract.mjs busyHolder) is never read of it.
 * `getContext()` is read at every admission and answers the deployment the request names and what this
 * client holds of it: `{ workspace: { id, scope, remote?, group? }, cli, localCwd, instances }`. `group` is
