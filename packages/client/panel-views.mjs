/** The deployments a client serves and the workspace views over them (#482, workspace-views.mjs; #855, 1d):
 * what the switcher lists, what a panel holds, and which deployment a request is addressed to.
 * A view is one per matched workspace identity, plus one per unattached deployment under that
 * deployment's own id. Everything is built per call from what the client holds; never a CLI read.
 *
 * No state. Every function that reads what a client holds takes it as its first argument, `held`,
 * reads it and never changes it. The client builds one per call from its own store:
 *
 *   held = {
 *     ctxs,              // string[]: this machine's deployments, in served order
 *     snapshot,          // { byWs: Map<deployment id, entry | remote panel> } (deployment-panel.mjs entries)
 *     remoteGroups,      // the last readable remote roster's groups (remote-roster.mjs)
 *     remembered,        // the remembered remote identities: an object with get(id), note(id), all()
 *     rosterAnswered,    // boolean: a roster answer arrived under the current CLI
 *     rosterFailure,     // string | null: the roster read's failure while no answer has arrived
 *     cli,               // the kernel record (cli-locator.mjs)
 *     observing,         // keyed by deployment id (`has`): a read in flight
 *     remoteCollecting,  // boolean: the remote roster is being read
 *     home,              // string: the user's home directory, for the short label
 *     at,                // string: the ISO time of this call
 *   }
 *
 * These functions read no clock: the one time they stamp is `held.at`, and the same `held` gives the
 * same answer. A remote deployment's panel is remote-roster.mjs `remotePanel`, made at `held.at`; what
 * a remote roster's answer becomes is that module's `remoteRosterState`, whose answer is the three
 * roster values of `held`.
 *
 * `remembered` is the client's own store, passed in: this module calls its three reading methods and
 * keeps nothing. `note(id)` answers the sentence left for a machine that moved to another workspace,
 * or null. The store's writing method is never called from here.
 *
 * A function that reaches a sentence or a label takes the client's terms (client-terms.mjs) after its
 * required arguments and before its optional ones, and throws without them.
 *
 * Not for a page: this module imports `node:path`, and so does deployment-panel.mjs. */
