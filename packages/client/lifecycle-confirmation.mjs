/** What a Stop or Retire plan and its answer say, and the client's half of the transaction: decide, then build.
 * No DOM and no IO: a client draws `planView`'s and `outcomeView`'s data its own way, and reaches its lifecycle
 * boundary (instance-lifecycle.mjs) through the `request` it gives `createLifecycleConfirmation`.
 *
 * What happened is shared; what to do next is each client's. Every sentence here is a fact about the plan or
 * its answer, or a next step that names an act every confirmation has (review again: `refresh`; check again:
 * `check-again`; update OATS). A next step that names a client's own furniture (a window, a roster, a command
 * line) is not here: a view names it by a code (`next`), and the client words it. Labels of controls are the
 * client's too; which controls exist is `state().offers`, and which choices, `planView(…).choices`.
 *
 * A client switches on codes and kinds, never on the words. Every wording function takes the client's terms
 * (client-terms.mjs) and refuses a call without them.
 *
 *   planView(plan, { operation, choices, leftover }, terms)
 *     -> { question, happening, state, warning, choices, applicable, notice, targets, own, at }
 *        happening: [{ text, path?, tone?, title? }]      tone: 'note' | 'attention'
 *        state:     { rows: [{ label, value, title }], notes: [{ text, tone, title? }] }
 *        choices:   [{ id, sentence, value, applies, offered }]   one per option the plan can carry
 *        notice:    null | { code: 'E_OPTION_UNAVAILABLE', sentence }   when the choices do not apply
 *   outcomeView(result, { target, operation, choices, plan, leftover }, terms)
 *     -> { kind, title, status, blocks, uncertain, plan?, planRef?, running? }
 *        kind:   'stale' | 'pending' | 'complete' | 'partial' | 'refused' | 'unknown' | 'invalid'
 *        status: { headline, more: [{ text } | { quote }], next: null | 'retire-with-force' | 'check-roster', code? }
 *        blocks: what is shown under the status, in order:
 *          { type: 'details', reason, bare }   a code and the kernel's line behind a disclosure
 *          { type: 'quote', text }             the kernel's own line, quoted
 *          { type: 'note', text }

 *   'applying'     the confirmation was sent: { view }
 *   'stale'        the plan changed: back to review with the fresh plan: { plan, planRef, view, notice }
 *   'settled'      an apply's answer: { view, result }
