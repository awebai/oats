/** The inspect boundary: one soul's or one instance home's inspection (`oats inspect --json`), through the
 * kernel's resolver, never a client's copy. A client makes one and asks it:
 *
 *   createInspectBoundary({ invoke, cache, maxAge, exec }) -> { inspect(request, context) }
 *
 *   invoke   the CLI call (cli-adapter.mjs `cliCapability`, the default)
 *   cache    an inspect cache the client made (inspect-cache.mjs `createInspectCache`); null: every inspect
 *            reaches the CLI
 *   maxAge   seconds the kernel may reuse remote observations on a miss (a local inspect only)
 *   exec     how the CLI is run (cli-adapter.mjs `runJson`'s `io.exec`); without it, execFile
 *
 *   request  { action: 'inspect', selector: { soul, agentsRoot } | { home }, refresh?, instructions?, skills?, composedSkills? }
 *   context  { workspace, cli, agents, instances, localCwd, catalogKey }
 *
 * It resolves the kernel's result with `observedAt` and `refreshing`, and throws an Error with a stable `code`
 * (and, for a host's refusal, a `reason`; for a refusal whose details name team labels, those `labels`).
 *
 * The boundary HOLDS NOTHING: what it keeps between calls is the cache it is given, which the client owns. A
 * client may make one boundary and keep it (the TUI: its own exec and cache) or make one per call (the
 * Desktop's capabilities.mjs, with the backend's cache): both are the same boundary only while that holds.
 * Never add a field, a map or a flight here; put it in the cache, or in a factory the client owns.
 *
 * The admission (`capabilityAdmission`: which workspace, which CLI, which action and flags, which one soul or
 * home) and the refusal of a failed answer (`capabilityFailure`) are this module's too, and the Desktop's
 * provider operations (capabilities.mjs, `run`) call the same two: a request is admitted one way, whatever it asks. */
