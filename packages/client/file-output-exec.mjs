/** The exec of a kernel change that must outlive the client: `execFile`'s signature and return (the child), with
 * the child's output in files, never in pipes. A client that quits, crashes or is signalled while a pipe's reader
 * is its own leaves the child writing into a pipe nobody reads: the write meets EPIPE (or SIGPIPE) and the change
 * dies half done. So the child writes to files of its own, which nothing the client does can close.
 *
 *   execFileToFiles(bin, argv, { cwd, env, encoding, maxBuffer }, callback) -> ChildProcess
 *
 * - The child starts in a session of its own (`detached`; `execFile` drops that option, so this stands on
 *   `spawn`), stdin `ignore`: a signal to the client's process group (Ctrl-C, a hang-up) never reaches it.
 * - Before the spawn: a private dir (`mkdtemp` under the OS temp dir, mode 0700) and two files in it (`wx`,
 *   0600), each with a write fd and a read fd. The write fds are the child's stdout and stderr. Right after the
 *   spawn the client's write fds are closed, both files unlinked and the dir removed: the child writes to its
 *   open inodes, the client reads back from its own fds, nothing is left on disk even after a client crash, and
 *   no path is reused. Any failure before the spawn returns closes and removes what was made, then throws.
 * - On the child's `close`, each read fd is read from position 0, bounded by `maxBuffer` (default 1 MiB, as
 *   execFile): more is a RangeError with code ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_STDIO_MAXBUFFER, over any exit status, with what
 *   fits passed on. The fds are closed, then the callback is called once, as execFile calls it: `(null, stdout,
 *   stderr)` after exit 0 with no signal; otherwise an Error with `code` (the exit status), `signal` and
 *   `killed: false`, and no text of the child's output in its message (it names the command, as execFile's). Text is `encoding` (default utf8); `'buffer'` or null gives Buffers. A spawn that
 *   fails (no pid) calls back with its error and empty output.
 * - IT NEVER SIGNALS THE CHILD: no kill timer, and a nonzero `timeout` throws a TypeError (no caller of this exec
 *   gives one; a caller ends its own wait, never the child). `shell` and `killSignal` are not read.
 * The TUI's `changeExec` (packages/tui/lib/read.mjs) keeps the same promise with its own lifecycle bookkeeping
 * (its run's directory, its let-go on the way out). */
