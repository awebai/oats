 * gains its first child stays where it was and becomes a group there; losing its last child, it rejoins the run
 * at the same place. A cluster's group is decided on the FULL roster: a filter or a collapse decides which rows
 * are listed and never moves a row to another group; a group with no visible row is left out. Returns
 * [{ key, label, clusters: [{ key, instances }] }], each cluster projected to its visible members, which carry
 * their tree depth. A group's key is unique even when two roots share a name (other agents roots or hosts), and
 * does not depend on what is visible: a cluster's is `cluster:<its place among the full roster's multi-member
 * clusters>:<name>`, a run's `independent:<instanceId of its first member in the full roster>`.
 * `lastFocus` (Map<instanceId, time>, optional; the command palette's, #1383): the full roster's clusters are
 * ordered by last focus (`recencyOrder`) before the groups form by the same rule, so a run is the consecutive
 * single clusters of that order, keyed by its first member there. What is visible still decides only which rows
 * are listed, never the order. Without it, the roster's own order (the sidebar's and the TUI's). */
