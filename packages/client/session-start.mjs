/** The start and restart rule of an existing instance (#855, 5a-2): whether a row can be started now
 * (`startGate`), the home a local start launches in (`verifiedLocalHome`), and the start itself
 * (`startInstance`). A client decides through these and words nothing of its own for them, except the codes
 * the rule leaves to it (below). Every function that words a sentence takes the client's `terms`
 * (client-terms.mjs) and refuses a call without them. No state.
 *
 * A failed start is one of two outcomes, and the words are "nothing was started", never "nothing happened"
 * (a restart that lost the race has already run its own stop, and a start may have written its pending receipt):
 *   refused    this request started nothing: every refusal of the gate and of the home check, the kernel's
 *              STARTED_NOTHING_CODES, and its CLAIM_STARTED_NOTHING_CODES from a kernel that holds the claim
 *              for a start;
 *   uncertain  anything else: no envelope, any other code, and E_START_UNCONFIRMED, the end of the wait
 *              for a start that goes on (cli-adapter.mjs cliStart: no deadline, START_WAIT_MS). That code
 *              carries no sentence: each client words it (the Desktop: renderer/start-unconfirmed.mjs).
 * After any failed start, refused or uncertain, the client reads the row again before it offers anything. */
