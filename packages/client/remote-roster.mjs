 * projected (`remotePanel`), and a failed read keeps the groups held, each marked not reached
 * (`unavailableGroups`). `rosterAnswered` says an answer arrived; `rosterFailure` is the failure's
 * sentence, kept only while none has. `reported` is what the client hands to its memory of identities
 * (remote-identity-memory.mjs `observeIdentities`): the groups of an `ok` envelope, else null.
 *
 * An answer read with workspace keys (`asked`) holds only the groups the kernel probed: those registered
 * for one of `keys`, those of unknown workspace and those known only from saved routes. It replaces
 * those. A held registered group it does not list, and whose last-known key (`keyOf(group)`:
 * `lastKnownKey`) is one the read did not ask for, was not probed: it is kept as it was last read, after the answer's
 * groups, and named in `kept` (its id, in order), so the caller keeps its read time (`keptReadTimes`).
 * A held group whose key is unknown, or is one of `keys`, or that is known only from saved routes
 * (`registrationPresent` false: the kernel always probes those), and that the answer does not list is
 * gone, as after any answer. `reported` then holds the kept groups too, so the memory keeps their identities.
 *
 * The sentence of a thrown read carries the message of an error from outside the client: a client
 * shows it through `displayLine` (display-text.mjs) only.
 *
 * What stays the caller's: one read at a time, when it runs, and dropping an answer that was read
 * with a kernel record that is no longer the accepted one. And its own `try`/`catch` around the read
 * and around what it does with `reported`: if that step throws after the caller took the new state, the
 * caller takes `{ thrown: <message> }` next, so the groups it just took are marked not reached.
