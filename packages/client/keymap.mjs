/** The keys both clients share: the leader, the table read after it, the plain keys of the list
 * of instances, the chords, and the palette's own keys. Written down once, here; the Desktop and the TUI read their defaults
 * from it (packages/tui/lib/actions.mjs LEADER is LEADER_TABLE, and the TUI's test
 * packages/tui/test/keymap.test.mjs fails on a `does` the TUI does not handle).
 *
 * Pure data and readers: no state, no DOM, no imports. Every value is frozen.
 *
 * Key ids are the TUI's spelling (packages/tui/lib/term/keys.mjs keyId): one character as itself,
 * case kept (`n`, `N`, `|`, `?`, `/`, `-`); named keys `up` `down` `left` `right` `tab` `escape`
 * `space` `enter` `home` `end` `pageup` `pagedown`; modifiers as `ctrl+` / `alt+` / `shift+`
 * prefixes, in that order. A chord adds two: `shift+` with Ctrl or Alt and a letter or an arrow
 * (`ctrl+alt+shift+e`, `alt+shift+up`), and `cmd+`, first, for macOS's Command (`cmd+k`, the
 * Desktop's ⌘K), which a terminal never passes to a program.
 *
 *   leaderKey(isMac)        -> the leader's key id on that platform        "ctrl+x" on both
 *   leaderDoes(key)         -> what the leader then does for a key id, or null
 *   plainKeys(does)         -> the plain key ids of an action (empty when it has none)
 *   leaderRows()            -> LEADER_TABLE
 *   chordKey(does, isMac, family)    -> the chord's key id on that platform and in that family, or null
 *   chordKeyOf(entry, isMac, family) -> the same for a CHORDS row (null where the row has none)
 *   doesLabel(does)         -> an action's label (its LEADER_TABLE row's, else its CHORDS row's), or null
 *   paletteKey(does, isMac) -> the palette's own key id on that platform, or null
 *
 * `does` names an action, not a client's code: each client maps it to its own. Its label, the words a
 * help names it by, is its LEADER_TABLE row's, else its CHORDS row's (`doesLabel`): a CHORDS row carries
 * a label only for an action the leader has no key for. The TUI's help reads it; the Desktop names its
 * actions in its own words (packages/desktop/renderer/leader-keys.mjs). */

/** The leader per platform: Ctrl+X on both, as Emacs has it (#1433). Without the kitty keyboard
 * protocol it is one byte, 0x18, in every terminal; pressed twice it sends that byte to the program
 * (the shell's Ctrl+X Ctrl+E, nano's exit). The Desktop leaves it to Cut in an editable field on
 * Linux and Windows (packages/desktop/docs/desktop-keyboard.md, "The leader"). */

 * the sidebar's list (`workspace-previous`, `workspace-next`); the previous and the next instance
 * are the chords' alone (CHORDS `previous`, `next`), which carry their own labels for it. Tab and

/** The chords: one key that does what the leader then a key does, from every focus, the same in
 * both clients, per platform (`mac`) and, on Linux and Windows, per chord family (`alt`, `other`,
 * `shift`: CHORD_FAMILIES). Three have no leader key: `previous` and `next` (the previous / next
 * instance, whose `label` is here, since no LEADER_TABLE row names them) and `edit-instance`. The
 * Desktop's DEFAULT_KEYMAP reads these entries from here (CHORDS_READ, docs/desktop-keyboard.md); the
 * TUI binds the family's ones, and the `mac` ones without `cmd+`, from every focus (docs/tui.md,
 * "Chords"). The leader stays the key that always works: help, the views and the acts (stop,
 * restart, start, retire) are reached by it alone.
 *
 * `alt`, the default family (Pepe's call, 2026-10-22; the maintainer's defaults, f592e979): Alt with
 * a letter or a digit for an action, Alt with an arrow to move between tabs (←/→) and workspaces
 * (↑/↓), Alt+Shift with an arrow between groups (←/→) and instances (↑/↓). These take keys a program
 * in a terminal reads (readline's M-b, M-f and M-digit, an agent's Alt+P); the program still gets
 * each from Esc, then the key, or the user picks Ctrl+Alt (docs/desktop-keyboard.md, the collision
 * table). Alt+letter is ESC then the letter in every terminal, and an Alt arrow has a sequence of its
 * own (`CSI 1;3A`, `CSI 1;4A` with Shift), so all of them reach the TUI with or without the kitty
 * keyboard protocol. A row without an `alt` key keeps its `other` one there.
 *
 * `other`, the Ctrl+Alt family, the option for whoever needs Alt in their programs: Ctrl+Alt with a
 * letter or a digit for an action, Alt+Shift with an arrow to move, and the workspace moves on Alt
 * ↑/↓, which nothing else there takes. A Ctrl+Alt chord reaches the TUI only under the kitty keyboard
 * protocol (ESC then Ctrl+K is what Ctrl+Alt+K sends without it). Its keys are unchanged from before
 * the Alt family; the previous group, whose Alt+Shift+← is the previous tab's here, is
 * Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A, the next group's Ctrl+Alt+A with Shift.
 *
 * `shift` is the row's key in the Ctrl+Shift family, the option a user picks in keys.json
 * (packages/client/keys-file.mjs) for a terminal that passes Ctrl+Shift apart from Ctrl: foot and
 * Alacritty (docs/tui.md, "Which family for my terminal"). Seven rows move (K palette, P spawn,
 * S workspaces, M zoom, W close, E split right, D split down: the maintainer's cut, a43470ce); the
 * others keep their `other` key: the Alt+Shift arrows, since Ctrl+Shift+arrow selects text in
 * inputs and editors; Ctrl+Alt+1–9, since Ctrl+Shift+digit is a shifted symbol on most layouts;
 * the groups and filter, whose Ctrl+Shift A and F a terminal or an agent takes; and edit-instance.
 *
 * On macOS the Desktop holds ⌘ (⌘⌥ for the rows new in phase 3); there is no family, `mac` is the
 * only key, and the rows new with the Alt family (the previous group, the workspace moves) have none
 * (`mac: null`): the leader reaches them. `tab-N` shows the Nth tab of the focused group, `tab-9`
 * its last. The Desktop's Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+1/2/3 (the stages) and Ctrl+, are the Desktop's own and are
 * not here. */
